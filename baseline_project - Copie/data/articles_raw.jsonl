Welcome to improving europe Why the EUâINC? Europe has the talent, ambition, and ecosystems to create innovative companies, but fragmentation between European nations is holding us back.  \"A startup from California can expand and raise money all across the United States. But our companies still face way too many national barriers that make it hard to work Europa-wide, and way too much regulatory burden.\" â Ursula von der Leyen, Oct 2024 Political Will Will this actually happen? Yes! But we need your help!  So far, we submitted our proposal to Justice Commissioner McGrath and Startup Commissioner Zaharieva.  President Von der Leyen has setup a dedicated working group in the Commission with whom we are in regular contact.  Additionally, the European Council and Parliament have each signaled interest in the EUâINC, or what in Brussel is called the \"28th regime\" (for 28th virtual state). ROADMAP What comes next? The entire community is currently influencing the upcoming European Commission legislative proposal for a pan-European legal entity which is set to be released in Q1 2026. We need your help, see below!  Afterwards, the European Parliament and the European Council (made up of the 27 national governments) agree on the legislative details.

Equivariant graph neural networks have revolutionized atomistic machine learning. Models like MACE, NequIP, and Allegro achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular dynamics simulations, materials property prediction, and drug discovery. Their secret: they respect the fundamental symmetries of physical systems - rotation, translation, and reflection invariance. But this mathematical elegance comes at a computational cost. The operations that make these models work - spherical harmonics and Clebsch-Gordan tensor products - are expensive. A single MACE layer can spend 80% of its forward pass time in these two operations. This matters for real applications. Molecular dynamics simulations run billions of timesteps. Battery materials discovery screens millions of candidates. Drug binding affinity predictions evaluate thousands of poses. When each forward pass takes milliseconds instead of microseconds, these workflows become impractical. To understand why equivariant GNNs are slow, we need to understand what they compute. When two atoms interact, the direction of their bond matters. A carbon-carbon bond pointing \"up\" is physically different from one pointing \"right\" - and our neural network needs to know this. Spherical harmonics (Y_lm) provide a mathematically principled way to encode 3D directions. Given a unit vector (x, y, z), spherical harmonics compute a set of features that transform predictably under rotation: For L_max=3, we get 16 components total: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. These aren't arbitrary features - they form a complete basis for functions on the sphere. When we want to combine two equivariant features (say, node features with edge directions), we can't just concatenate or add them - that would break equivariance.

On the western flank of the Hoover Dam stands a little-understood monument, commissioned by the US Bureau of Reclamation when construction of the dam began in 01931. The most noticeable parts of this corner of the dam, now known as Monument Plaza, are the massive winged bronze sculptures and central flagpole which are often photographed by visitors. The most amazing feature of this plaza, however, is under their feet as they take those pictures. The plaza’s terrazzo floor is actually a celestial map that marks the time of the dam’s creation based on the 25,772-year axial precession of the earth. I was particularly interested in this monument because this axial precession is also the slowest cycle that we track in Long Now’s 10,000 Year Clock. Strangely, little to no documentation of this installation seemed to be available, except for a few vacation pictures on Flickr. So the last time I was in Las Vegas, I made a special trip out to Hoover Dam to see if I could learn more about this obscure 26,000-year monument. I parked my rental car on the Nevada side of the dam on a day pushing 100 degrees. I quickly found Monument Plaza just opposite the visitor center where tours of the dam are offered. While the plaza is easy to find, it stands apart from all the main tours and stories about the dam. With the exception of the writing in the plaza floor itself, the only information I could find came from a speaker running on loop, broadcasting a basic description of the monument while visitors walked around the area. When I asked my tour guide about it, he suggested that there may be some historical documentation and directed me to Emme Woodward, the dam’s historian.

But what does this actually mean? The obvious literal interpretation is for a device to be PC compatible, all software originally written for the IBM 5150 must run on it. Is this a reasonable definition? Is it one that any modern hardware can meet? Before we dig into that, let’s go back to the early days of the x86 industry. IBM had launched the PC built almost entirely around off-the-shelf Intel components, and shipped full schematics in the IBM PC Technical Reference Manual . Anyone could buy the same parts from Intel and build a compatible board. They’d still need an operating system, but Microsoft was happy to sell MS-DOS to anyone who’d turn up with money. The only thing stopping people from cloning the entire board was the BIOS, the component that sat between the raw hardware and much of the software running on it. The concept of a BIOS originated in CP/M , an operating system originally written in the 70s for systems based on the Intel 8080. At that point in time there was no meaningful standardisation - systems might use the same CPU but otherwise have entirely different hardware, and any software that made assumptions about the underlying hardware wouldn’t run elsewhere. CP/M’s BIOS was effectively an abstraction layer, a set of code that could be modified to suit the specific underlying hardware without needing to modify the rest of the OS. As long as applications only called BIOS functions, they didn’t need to care about the underlying hardware and would run on all systems that had a working CP/M port. By 1979, boards based on the 8086, Intel’s successor to the 8080, were hitting the market. The 8086 wasn’t machine code compatible with the 8080, but 8080 assembly code could be assembled to 8086 instructions to simplify porting old code. Despite this, the 8086 version of CP/M was taking", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

The vast majority of AI-generated error reports submitted to cURL are pure nonsense. Other open source projects are caught in the same pandemic. cURL maintainer Daniel Stenberg made an impact with his reporting on AI-generated bug reports last year – ” Death by a thousand slops .” Determining that they are nonsense is time-consuming, causing the maintainers lots of extra work. ”AI slop and bad reports in general have been increasing even more lately, so we have to try to brake the flood in order not to drown”, says cURL maintainer Daniel Stenberg to Swedish electronics industry news site etn.se. Therefore, cURL is terminating the bounty payouts as of the end of January. “We hope this removes some of the incentives for people to send us garbage.

External mirrors or forks may contain malware. Bound Book Format (.bbf) is a high-performance binary container designed specifically for digital comic books and manga. Unlike CBR/CBZ, BBF is built for DirectSotrage/mmap, easy integrity checks, and mixed-codec containerization. Linux Windows Alternatively, if you need python support, use libbbf-python . BBF is designed as a Footer-indexed binary format. This allows for rapid append-only creation and immediate random access to any page without scanning the entire file. The bbfmux reference implementation utilizes Memory Mapping (mmap/MapViewOfFile) . Instead of reading file data into intermediate buffers, the tool maps the container directly into the process address space. This allows the CPU to access image data at the speed of your NVMe drive's hardware limit. Integrity checks utilize Parallel XXH3 . On multi-core systems, the verifier splits the asset table into chunks and validates multiple pages simultaneously. This makes BBF verification up to 10x faster than ZIP/RAR CRC checks. Every asset in a BBF file starts on a 4096-byte boundary . This alignment is critical for modern hardware, allowing for DirectStorage transfers directly from disk to GPU memory, bypassing CPU bottlenecks entirely.

The fundamental issue here is conflating NAT (Network Address Translation) with security. NAT isnât actually a security featureâitâs an address conservation mechanism that became necessary because we ran out of IPv4 addresses. (Although it is totally possible to use a NAT with IPv6 too!) NAT allows multiple devices on a home network to share a single IP address on the public Internet by rewriting the destination IP of a packet based on its destination port. It chooses a new destination IP based on the âport mappingsâ or âport forwardsâ configured by the network admin. The consequence of this is that when receiving inbound traffic to a NATâd IP, packets with an unexpected destination port (one which has not been forwarded) will keep the destination IP of the public machine and will not be routed to another machine on the network. But the security benefits people attribute to NAT actually come from the stateful firewall thatâs typically bundled with NAT routers. Modern routers ship with firewall policies that deny inbound traffic by default, even when a NAT is not being used. The firewall will drop packets with an unexpected destination before even considering whether to rewrite or route the packets. For example, UniFi routers ship with these default IPv6 firewall rules: Therefore, in order to allow unsolicited inbound traffic to any IPv6 device hosted behind the router, you must explicitly add a firewall rule to allow the traffic, whether using a NAT or not.", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

Table of Contents  Imagine you have this table of users: For each user you keep their name and which payment plan they're on. There are only two plans, \"free\" and \"pro\", so you add a check constraint. Generate some data and analyze the table: You now have 100K users in the system. Now you want to let your analysts access this table in their reporting tool of choice. You give one of the analysts permission, and this is the first query they write: The query returned no results, and the analyst is baffled. How come there are no users on the \"Pro\" plan? The name of the plan is \"pro\" and not \"Pro\" (with a capital \"P\") as the analyst wrote it. This is an honest mistake really, anyone can make such a mistake! But what is the cost of this mistake? Examine the execution plan of a query for a non-existing value: PostgreSQL scanned the entire table! However, there's a check constraint on the field - no row can ever have the value \"Pro\", the database makes sure of that! So if this condition always evaluates to false, why is PostgreSQL scanning the table? PostgreSQL is smart enough to skip a table scan when the query contains a condition that always evaluates to false, but not by default! To instruct PostgreSQL to look at constraints when generating a plan, you need to set the parameter constraint_exclusion : Nice! After turning constraint_exclusion on, PostgreSQL figured out based on the check constraint that the condition won't return any rows, and skipped the scan entirely. So who are you constraint_exclusion and why are you not on by default?

The data, collected by the U.S. Drought Monitor , is a welcome nugget of news for Golden State residents, who in the last 15 years alone have lived through two of the worst droughts on record, the worst wildfire seasons on record and the most destructive wildfires ever. Right now, the wildfire risk across California is “about as close to zero as it ever gets,” and there is likely no need to worry about the state’s water supply for the rest of the year, said UC climate scientist Daniel Swain. Currently, 14 of the state’s 17 major water supply reservoirs are at 70% or more capacity, according to the California Department of Water Resources .        California’s last drought lasted more than 1,300 days, from February 2020 to October 2023, at which point just 0.7% of the state remained abnormally dry, thanks to a series of winter atmospheric rivers that showered the Golden State with rain. Before that, California was in a severe drought from 2012 through 2016. But the last time 0% of the California map had any level of abnormally dry or drought conditions was all the way back in December 2000. In recent weeks, a series of powerful winter storms and atmospheric rivers have swept across California, dumping heavy rain that soaked soils, filled reservoirs and left much of the state unusually wet for this time of year. “This is certainly a less destructive weather winter than last year was and than many of the drought years were, so it’s OK to take that breather and to acknowledge that, right now, things are doing OK,” Swain said.

This was in the late 1970s. Along with learning cursive and the referents of rosary beads, we learned that the base-10 system would be critically important in all things science and engineering. This focus on metric stemmed from the Metric Conversion Act, passed in Congress in 1975, and the United States Metric Board that it created. Forward-thinking members of Congress and President Gerald Ford wanted us kids to join the rest of the world in thinking about distances in kilometers and weight in kilos. Signing the bill in December 1975, Ford argued that our continued use of U.S. customary (the more accurate name for what’s sometimes the called the British Imperial system) had created “an island in a metric sea.” But this well-intentioned legislation had a problem: It made the change to metric, in the words of the act, “completely voluntary.” So after a brief burst of attention to metric, many of us pretty much forgot about it, except when running a 10K or buying a 2-liter bottle of soda. President Ronald Reagan disbanded the Metric Board in 1982. But in reality, metric never really left. As Elizabeth Benham pointed out in her article for the National Institute of Standards and Technology , U.S. customary units have been defined in terms of metric units since 1893. And even though the progress has been slow, the U.S. has continued toward conversion, as Ross Rowlett described in his short history of metric in the U.S. Indeed, numerous manufacturers, including Caterpillar, Ingersoll-Rand, and General Motors, have adopted metric to facilitate their participation in the global economy.

Letâs see what has changed in the past 12 months in addressing the Internet and look at how IP address allocation information can inform us of the changing nature of the network itself. Back around 1992, the IETF gazed into their crystal ball and tried to understand how the Internet was going to evolve and what demands that would place on the addressing system as part of the âIP Next Generationâ study.  The staggeringly large numbers of connected devices that we see today were certainly within the range predicted by that study. The assumption made at the time was that we would continue to use much the same IP protocol architecture, including the requirement that each connected device was assigned a unique IP address, and the implication was that the 32-bit address field defined in version 4 of the IP protocol was clearly going to be inadequate to cope with the predicted number of connected devices. A span of 4 billion address values was just not large enough. We concluded at the time that the only way we could make the Internet work across such a massive pool of connected devices was to deploy a new IP protocol that came with a massively larger address space. It was from this reasoning that IPv6 was designed, as this world of abundant silicon processors connected to a single public Internet was the scenario that IPv6 was primarily intended to solve. The copious volumes of a 128-bit address space were intended to allow us to uniquely assign a public IPv6 address to every such device, no matter how small, or in whatever volume they might be deployed. But while the Internet has grown at amazing speeds across the ensuing 33 years, the deployment of IPv6 has proceeded at a more measured pace.

Each of these states represents differences in many\nparameters (font size, colour, gradient, opacity, border, padding, margin,\nwidth, height, etc). These complexities are abstracted away giving the consuming\ncode the list of states to chose from, so that they can write code like this. Under the hood of course many aspects of the CSS or HTML code will be impacted\nby the change of state so you often end up with different parts of the markup\nhaving conditionals on the same check. Just in this contrived example you already have 2 different things being\ncontrolled by the state property with 2 separate checks, the CSS classes and the\npresence of the loading icon.

January 20, 2026 Throughout 2025, we got better estimates of electricity and water use of AI chatbots. There are all sorts of posts I could cite on this topic, but a favorite is this blog post from Our World in Data’s Hannah Ritchie. On the electricity front:  In short, “unless you’re an extreme power user, asking AI questions every day is still a rounding error on your total electricity footprint.” A similar story applies to water usage. This one from Benjamin Todd : The average American uses 1600 liters of water per day , so even if you make 100 prompts per day, at 2ml per prompt, that’s only 0.01% of your total water consumption. Using a shower for one second would use far more. Generally, these analyses guide my own thinking about the environmental impacts of my individual usage of LLMs; if I’m interested in reducing my personal carbon footprint, I’m much better off driving a couple miles less a week or avoiding one flight each year. This is indeed the right conclusion for users of chat interfaces like chatgpt.com or claude.ai. That said, 1 or 10 or 100 median prompts a day is many orders of magnitude off from my own personal use of LLMs; I likely am, in Hannah Ritchie’s words, an “extreme power user.” I work in software and spend much of my workday driving 2 or 3 coding agents, like Claude Code, at a time. Thus, a much more relevant question for me is how much energy does a typical Claude Code session consume? (I’m not going to discuss water use in this post.) tl;dr, much more:  There are so many considerations and assumptions and pieces of shorthand one must use along the way to answer this sort of question. I’ll do my best to call those out throughout this post, but please do understand this is still just Sunday afternoon napkin math from Some Guy. tl;dr: In this section, I point out that a Claude Code session should use orders of mag", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

For the past week, I’ve found myself playing the same 23-second CNN clip on repeat. I’ve watched it in bed, during my commute to work, at the office, midway through making carrot soup, and while brushing my teeth. In the video, Harry Enten, the network’s chief data analyst, stares into the camera and breathlessly tells his audience about the gambling odds that Donald Trump will buy any of Greenland. “The people who are putting their money where their mouth is—they are absolutely taking this seriously,” Enten says. He taps the giant touch screen behind him and pulls up a made-for-TV graphic: Based on how people were betting online at the time, there was a 36 percent chance that the president would annex Greenland. “Whoa, way up there!” Enten yells, slapping his hands together. “My goodness gracious!” The ticker at the bottom of the screen speeds through other odds: Will Gavin Newsom win the next presidential election? 19 percent chance. Will Viktor Orbán be out as the leader of Hungary before the end of the year? 48 percent chance.  These odds were pulled from Kalshi, which hilariously claims not to be a gambling platform: It’s a “prediction market.” People go to sites such as Kalshi and Polymarket—another big prediction market—in order to put money down on a given news event.

PersonaPlex and Rajarshi Roy sharing jokes. Conversational AI has forced an impossible choice. Traditional systems (ASRâLLMâTTS cascades) let you customize the voice and role, but conversations feel robotic with awkward pauses, no interruptions, and unnatural turn-taking. Full-duplex models like Moshi finally made AI conversations feel natural with real-time listening and speaking, but locked you into a single fixed voice and role.\nNVIDIA PersonaPlex breaks this trade-off. Select from a diverse range of voices and define any role through text prompts. Need a wise assistant, a customer service agent, a fantasy character, or just someone to talk to? PersonaPlex delivers truly natural conversations while maintaining your chosen persona throughout. It handles interruptions, backchannels, and authentic conversational rhythm. For the first time, you get both the customization you need and the naturalness that makes conversations feel genuinely human. PersonaPlex is a full duplex model: it listens and speaks at the same time. This capability, first introduced with Moshi, lets PersonaPlex learn not only the contents of its speech but also the behavior associated with speech, such as when to pause, interrupt, or backchannel (âuh-huhâ, âohâ, etc.). We achieve low-latency interaction by eliminating delays associated with cascaded systems that use separate models for listening (Automated Speech Recognition), language production (Language Model), and speaking (Text to Speech). Our approach uses a single model that updates its internal state as the user speaks and streams a response back immediately. Enriching PersonaPlexâs output with non-verbal aspects creates an important qualitative difference relative to systems without this dimension: PersonaPlex now recreates some of the same cues humans use to read intent, emo", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

Still, he loves his work, to the point that if he has no work to take home with him, he does some recreational copying just for his own sake. Akaky is a dysfunctional person. But his dysfunction makes him a perfect fit for his job 2 . It’s hard for me to see a problem and not solve it. This is especially true if I’m the only person (or one of a very few people) who could solve it, or if somebody is asking for my help. I feel an almost physical discomfort about it, and a corresponding relief and satisfaction when I do go and solve the problem.

In other words, like Akaky Akaievich, I don’t mind the ways in which my job is dysfunctional, because it matches the ways in which I myself am dysfunctional: specifically, my addiction to being useful .

{"title": "Apples, Trees, and Quasimodes", "url": "https://systemstack.dev/2025/09/humane-computing/", "content": "September 18, 2025 A while back, Ars Technica published a thoughtful piece about Jef Raskin , tracing his long pursuit of the “humane computer” and the cul-de-sacs where that pursuit ended. It’s a generous, well-told account of the designer who wanted to make machines simpler, kinder, and more aligned with the way people actually think. But part of what makes Raskin interesting is that his story isn’t just Apple’s story. He came out of the same cultural current John Markoff chronicled in What the Dormouse Said —the Bay Area tradition that treated computers not as office appliances but as tools for thought, instruments of liberation. Read that way, the Canon Cat and Raskin’s other projects aren’t just an eccentric side quest from a frustrated Apple veteran. It’s evidence of how far the humane ideal could stretch, and how quickly it ran up against the limits of commercial computing. Apple couldn’t deliver Raskin’s vision then, and it can’t deliver it now. Neither can any other big platform company. If we want to understand why, and what Raskin still tells us about humane computing, we have to put him back in the longer lineage he belonged to, and look at how his version of the dream carried that vision but also narrowed it. What the Dormouse Said documents how the Bay Area counterculture  shaped early personal computing. LSD, communes, systems theory, amorphous defense research contracts, and Engelbart’s “augmentation” experiments all swirled together in a weird scene that accidentally (or maybe not so accidentally) created much of the modern world. The story usually gets told with a neat list: Engelbart’s demo , Nelson’s Xanadu hypertext, Kay’s Dynabook , Brand’s Whole Earth . Xerox PARC, Steve Jobs, the World Wide Web. The familiar pantheon. But that version turns a messy, improvisational moment into a plaque. Engelbart’s system needed a whole research staff just to operate; Nelson’s Xanadu was (and is) more sermon than software; Kay’s Dynabook lived mostly on paper", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

I didn’t expect to get such a high answer, but read on to see how\nwe can find out. When we predicted the Dow Jones index crossing a barrier in 2023 , we treated the\nindex as an unbiased random walk.

Humanoid’s HMND 01 wheeled Alpha robot was deployed in real operations at a Siemens facility, marking a significant step toward the deployment of humanoid robots in industrial settings. This successful POC is the first step in a broader partnership between the two companies to test and validate how humanoid robots can be used in real-world environments. The POC focused on a tote-to-conveyor destacking task within Siemens’ logistics process. In this use case, the robot autonomously picked totes from a storage stack, transported them to a conveyor, and placed them at the designated pickup point for human operators. This sequence was repeated until the stack was fully empty, which demonstrated how humanoid robots can take on repetitive logistics tasks.  The POC was structured in two phases. The first one focused on in-house development and demonstration and has already been completed. During this stage, the Humanoid team built a physical twin to support testing, optimization, and rapid iteration throughout the POC. The second phase involved a two-week on-site deployment at the Siemens Electronics Factory in Erlangen, where partners assessed the robots in a real-world production environment. This joint POC measured both performance and reliability of humanoid robots under autonomous operation. Target metrics were met in full and included a throughput of 60 tote moves per hour, operation with two different tote sizes, continuous autonomous task execution for more than 30 minutes, uptime exceeding 8 hours. The team also evaluated the POC’s success using the following indicators: overall pick and place success rate and autonomous pick and place success rate, both above 90%.

At some point I realized that rather than do something else until it finishes, I would constantly check on it to see if it was asking for yet another permission, which felt like it was missing the point of having an agent do stuff. So I wanted to use Claude Code with the --dangerously-skip-permissions flag. If you haven’t used it, this flag does exactly what it says: it lets Claude Code do whatever it wants without asking permission first. No more “May I install this package?”, “Should I modify this config?”, “Can I delete these files?” It just… does it. Which is great for flow since I don’t have to worry that it stopped doing stuff just to ask a permission question. But also, you know, dangerous. I like my filesystem intact, so the obvious solution is to not run this thing directly on my OS account. First instinct: throw it in a Docker container. Containers are for isolation, right? Except I want Claude to be able to build Docker images. And run containers. And maybe orchestrate some stuff. So now you need Docker-in-Docker, which means --privileged mode, which defeats the entire purpose of sandboxing. That means trading “Claude might mess up my filesystem” for “Claude has root-level access to my container runtime.” Not great. There’s also the nested networking weirdness, volume mounting permissions that make you question your life choices, and the general feeling that you’re fighting the tool instead of using it. I also briefly considered: Then I remembered about a project that I’ve used before Docker became all the rage: Vagrant. If you weren’t around back then, Vagrant gives you proper VM isolation with a reproducible config file. It’s basically infrastructure as code for your local dev environment. You get: I hadn’t used VirtualBox in years since Docker containers covered all requirements until now, so I grabbed the latest version (7.2.4) and got started.

That's at least part of the reasoning behind the existence of the LG UltraFine Evo 6K. This 32-inch monitor aims to put even more pixels in front of content creators and professionals. Beyond that, it has an attention-grabbing design and off-the-charts image quality. It's one of the best monitors you can buy for content creators, despite some of the unfortunate trade-offs it comes with. The 32-inch LG UltraFine Evo 6K is a very pretty monitor. I wouldn't blame you for mistaking this as an Apple product, given the focus on clean lines, simple shapes, and designerly aesthetic. The extra-wide stand means that the base itself isn’t overly large. Like the Apple Studio Display , the flat base provides more usable desk space rather than occupying it. The stand itself has a unique design, too. It resembles the styling Apple uses on the iMac and Studio Display, but it has a textured pattern on the back. It’s gorgeous, though you probably won’t spend a lot of time looking at the back of the monitor unless your desk is in the middle of the room or in command position (if you know, you know). I also like that the back of the cabinet is flat, giving it a sleek look that the rounded backs of typical monitors can’t achieve. Because it uses conventional backlighting, though, it’s not as thin as OLED displays like some of Samsung’s Odyssey gaming monitors . The UltraFine 6K also has some impressively thin bezels, too, adding to the ultra-modern aesthetic. While they’re not “virtually borderless” as LG states, they’re smaller than the bezels on most monitors I’ve tested. One of my favorite aspects of the UltraFine Evo 6K is the speakers. The pair of included speakers on this might be the best I've heard on a monitor. They are extremely loud and clear. There's even a decent amount of bass in there, to the point where you won't need a pair of computer speakers .

This is widely considered some of the worst odds in gambling. Yet on Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market, traders have wagered vast sums on longshot contracts with historical returns as low as 43 cents on the dollar. Thousands of participants are voluntarily accepting expected values far lower than a casino slot machine to bet on their convictions. The efficient market hypothesis suggests that asset prices should perfectly aggregate all available information. Prediction markets theoretically provide the purest test of this theory. Unlike equities, there is no ambiguity about intrinsic value. A contract either pays $1 or it does not. A price of 5 cents should imply exactly a 5% probability. We analyzed 72.1 million trades covering $18.26 billion in volume to test this efficiency. Our findings suggest that collective accuracy relies less on rational actors than on a mechanism for harvesting error. We document a systematic wealth transfer where impulsive Takers pay a structural premium for affirmative \"YES\" outcomes while Makers capture an \"Optimism Tax\" simply by selling into this biased flow. The effect is strongest in high-engagement categories like Sports and Entertainment, while low-engagement categories like Finance approach perfect efficiency. This paper makes three contributions. First, it confirms the presence of the longshot bias on Kalshi and quantifies its magnitude across price levels. Second, it decomposes returns by market role, revealing a persistent wealth transfer from takers to makers driven by asymmetric order flow. Third, it identifies a YES/NO asymmetry where takers disproportionately favor affirmative bets at longshot prices, exacerbating their losses. Prediction markets are exchanges where participants trade binary contracts on real-world outcomes. These contracts settle at either $1 or $0, with prices ranging from 1 to 99 cents serving as probability proxies. Unli", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

For those unfamiliar with Shadcn, it's a UI framework that provides a bunch of\nprebuilt UI components for use in your websites. Unlike traditional UI\nframeworks like Bootstrap, you don't import it with a script tag or npm install . Instead you run a command that copies the components into your\ncodebase. Here's the code that was exported from Shadcn into our project: Woof... 3 imports and 45 lines of code. And it's importing a third party icon\nlibrary just to render a circle.

Big Tech’s AI-fueled memory shortage is set to be the PC industry’s defining story for 2026 and beyond. Standalone, direct-to-consumer RAM kits were some of the first products to feel the bite, with prices spiking by 300 or 400 percent by the end of 2025 ; prices for SSDs had also increased noticeably, albeit more modestly. The rest of 2026 is going to be all about where, how, and to what extent those price spikes flow downstream into computers , phones, and other components that use RAM and NAND chips—areas where the existing supply of products and longer-term supply contracts negotiated by big companies have helped keep prices from surging too noticeably so far. This week, we’re seeing signs that the RAM crunch is starting to affect the GPU market—Asus made some waves when it inadvertently announced that it was discontinuing its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti . Though the company has since tried to walk this announcement back, if you’re a GPU manufacturer, there’s a strong argument for either discontinuing this model or de-prioritizing it in favor of other GPUs. The 5070 Ti uses 16GB of GDDR7, plus a partially disabled version of Nvidia’s GB203 GPU silicon. This is the same chip and the same amount of RAM used in the higher-end RTX 5080—the thinking goes, why continue to build a graphics card with an MSRP of $749 when the same basic parts could go to a card with a $999 MSRP instead ? Whether Asus or any other company is canceling production or not, you can see why GPU makers would be tempted by the argument: Street prices for the RTX 5070 Ti models start in the $1,050 to $1,100 range on Newegg right now, where RTX 5080 cards start in the $1,500 to $1,600 range. Though 5080 models may need more robust boards, heatsinks, and other components than a 5070 Ti, if you’re just trying to maximize the profit-per-GPU you can get for the same amount of RAM, it makes sense to shift allocation to the more ex", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

Some users on iOS 26.3 are noticing that the blue background around sponsored results is no longer shown, blurring the line between what paid ad results look like and the real search results that follow. This means the only differentiator between organic results and the promoted ad is the presence of the small ‘Ad’ banner next to the app icon. Right now, it appears to be in some kind of A/B test phase. We have asked Apple for clarity on the change, and whether this will roll out more widely in the future. It may be related to the company’s announcement from December that App Store search results will soon start including more than one sponsored result for a given search query. The removal of the blue background will mean all of the ads will appear in the list in a more integrated fashion. Of course, this also has the effect of making it harder for users to quickly distinguish at a glance what is an ad and what isn’t, potentially misleading some users into not realising that the first result is a paid ad placement. While not great for user experience, it probably helps increase click-through rates which ultimately boosts Apple’s revenue in its ads business. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

I've seen this first hand in my conversations with dozens of friends and across more than 100 job interviews. Here is my response to these people: you can drastically increase your odds of getting a job by making targeted bets rather than broadly applying and hoping something sticks. A targeted bet begins with focus. Instead of applying broadly, identify 5-10 specific opportunities you genuinely want. In the context of job searching, these are roles where at least one of the following is true: Once the list has been narrowed, your goal is to stand out. Here are a few ways to do that: By narrowing your opportunities, you end up being able to spend more time on each one. Let's assume that a targeted bet increases your chances of getting a job from 1% to 10%. The average number of jobs you'd need to apply to before getting one thus jumps from 100 to just 10! Competitive systems reward effort per attempt, not volume. Targeted bets apply to more than just the job search. I recently scored the first apartment I applied to in a highly-competitive San Francisco neighborhood. I was specific in where and what I was looking for, so when the opportunity came up, I was able to devote lots of time and energy into getting it. I applied just 6 hours after the place came on the market. Seeing that there were lots of people at the tour, I sent a follow up email to the leasing agent explaining how I'd always wanted to live in the neighborhood. If I had been worried about the status of my other applications, I may not have had the time to write that follow up email and secure my apartment. The glory in making targeted bets is that you get to spend more time on the things that you really care about.

It just turns out as an organization grows, it operates on fractured sets of implicit assumptions. I found there is often little disagreement on what the problems are, but plenty of disagreement on which were more important. People then carry these differences into decision making without revealing their working assumptions, cascading tradeoffs are made and efforts diverge. There was an incredible sense of clarity when everyone could agree on what’s most important in unison, and I wanted to get there. I started by doing the exercise of stack ranking priorities. Sometimes this would just be finger to the wind thinking about issues, sometimes this would mean months of work to assess impact rigorously. I would challenge others in the company to make their own stack rankings. We’d then discuss the differences and try to converge on a shared ordering. This was an incredibly fruitful exercise that led to great conversations. With more than two people though, as with an exec team, there was a need for more process. It turns out there’s a whole branch of mathematics called voting theory all about how to get a plurality of people to agree on a single thing.

To the uninitiated, this is easiest understood by example: imagine a university with many colleges , each with many departments , which in turn have many professors . If modeled incorrectly, where the professors are given 1:N relations with colleges instead of departments , the result is a fan trap: These relations arenât wrong per se, but the mapping of professors to departments is lost. The resulting data modeling diagram looks like two hand fans joined at the narrow end, hence the name. A similar problem can occur in system diagramming. When diagramming relations between resources in a system, information can similarly be lost when relations flow through an intermediary resource. In this article, weâll look at a couple of examples of this problem and three potential fixes. Fan traps are common problems when diagramming event-driven architectures. The defining characteristic of such architectures is that resources communicate via events . Events are typically routed through an event broker, which temporarily stores them until they are ready for consumption. This architecture has the added benefit of decoupling the resources, since they no longer communicate directly. When diagrammed, a (highly simplified) event-driven system might look like so: The similarity to fan traps in data modeling should be evident at a glance. The relationships between the message-producing resources (on the left) and message-consuming resources (on the right) are lost because they collapse at the center of the âfanâ (the event broker). The diagram implies each producer communicates with all of the consumers, even though this may not be the case: The same problem can emerge when diagramming communication paths in a network: In the (again highly simplified) networking diagram above, node-to-node communications across the network fan out and back in through f", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

I (the human here, Salvatore) wanted to test code generation with a more ambitious task, over the weekend. This is the result. It is my first open source project where I wrote zero lines of code. I believe that inference systems not using the Python stack (which I do not appreciate) are a way to free open models usage and make AI more accessible. There is already a project doing the inference of diffusion models in C / C++ that supports multiple models, and is based on GGML. I wanted to see if, with the assistance of modern AI, I could reproduce this work in a more concise way, from scratch, in a weekend. Looks like it is possible. This code base was written with Claude Code, using the Claude Max plan, the small one of ~80 euros per month. I almost reached the limits but this plan was definitely sufficient for such a large task, which was surprising. In order to simplify the usage of this software, no quantization is used, nor do you need to convert the model. It runs directly with the safetensors model as input, using floats. Even if the code was generated using AI, my help in steering towards the right design, implementation choices, and correctness has been vital during the development. I learned quite a few things about working with non trivial projects and AI. That's it. No Python runtime, no PyTorch, no CUDA toolkit required at inference time.

Below is the result — try dragging it around, the demo is interactive! One thing I spent a lot of effort on is getting edges looking sharp. Take a look at this rotating cube example: Try opening the “split” view. Notice how well the characters follow the contour of the square. This renderer works well for animated scenes, like the ones above, but we can also use it to render static images: The image of Saturn was generated with ChatGPT . Then, to get better separation between different colored regions, I also implemented a cel shading -like effect to enhance contrast between edges. Try dragging the contrast slider below: The contrast enhancement makes the separation between different colored regions far clearer. That was key to making the 3D scene above look as good as it does. I put so much focus on sharp edges because they’re an aspect of ASCII rendering that is often overlooked when programmatically rendering images as ASCII. Consider this animated 3D scene from Cognition’s landing page that is rendered via ASCII characters: Source: cognition.ai It’s a cool effect, especially while in motion, but take a look at those blurry edges! The characters follow the cube contours very poorly, and as a result, the edges look blurry and jagged in places: This blurriness happens because the ASCII characters are being treated like pixels — their shape is ignored. It’s disappointing to see because ASCII art looks so much better when shape is utilized. I don’t believe I’ve ever seen shape utilized in generated ASCII art, and I think that’s because it’s not really obvious how to consider shape when building an ASCII renderer.

But around Christmas, the growth chart went vertical. In just a few days, the repository jumped from relative obscurity to nearly 2,500 stars. The website traffic mirrored this spike. Something had clicked. But the real story wasnât in the metricsâit was in who was talking about AI agents. Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux and Git, wrote about using AI coding agents for âvibe codingâ and programming guitar pedal effects. Think about that for a second. The person who literally invented the version control system that powers modern software development was publicly embracing agents. Tobias LÃ¼tke, CEO of Shopify and already deep into agent-assisted development, declared it his âmost productive time.â This from someone running one of the worldâs largest e-commerce platforms. Perhaps most telling was Armin Ronacher, creator of Flaskâone of the most respected voices in Python. He had been skeptical of coding agents, publicly raising concerns about their limitations. Then, seemingly overnight, his stance shifted. He started promoting agent-assisted workflows, documenting his learnings, and acknowledging that the technology had crossed a threshold.

Wait… Wait… Wait… Compiling code usually means waiting, but Turbopack makes iteration loops fast with caching and incremental computation. Not every modern bundler uses an incremental approach, and that’s with good reason. Incremental computation can introduce significant complexity and opportunities for bugs. Caches require extra tracking and copies of data, adding both CPU and memory overhead. When applied poorly, caching can actually make performance worse. Despite all of this, we took on these challenges because we knew that an incremental architecture would be critical to Turbopack’s success. Turbopack is the new default bundler for Next.js, a framework that is used to build some of the largest web applications in the world . We needed to enable instant builds and a fast as-you-type interactive React Fast Refresh experience, even for the largest and most challenging workloads. Our incremental architecture is core to achieving this. Turbopack’s architecture was built ground-up with caching in mind. Its incremental design is based on over a decade of research. We built on first-hand experience from challenges in implementing caching in webpack and drew inspiration from Salsa (which powers Rust-Analyzer and Ruff ), Parcel , the Rust compiler’s query system , Adapton , and many others. Turbopack achieves a fine-grained cache by automatically tracking how internal functions are called and what values they depend on. When something changes we know how to recompute the results with minimal work. Many build systems include explicit dependency graphs that must be manually populated when evaluating build rules. Explicitly declaring your dependency graph can theoretically give optimal results, but in practice it leaves room for errors. The difficulty of specifying an explicit dependency graph means that usually caching is done at a coarse file-level granularity.

In the next stage, post-training, we select one particular character from this enormous cast and place it center stage: the Assistant. It’s in this character that most modern language models interact with users. But who exactly is this Assistant? Perhaps surprisingly, even those of us shaping it don't fully know. We can try to instill certain values in the Assistant, but its personality is ultimately shaped by countless associations latent in training data beyond our direct control. What traits does the model associate with the Assistant? Which character archetypes is it using for inspiration? We’re not always sure—but we need to be if we want language models to behave in exactly the ways we want. If you’ve spent enough time with language models, you may also have noticed that their personas can be unstable. Models that are typically helpful and professional can sometimes go “off the rails” and behave in unsettling ways, like adopting evil alter egos , amplifying users’ delusions , or engaging in blackmail in hypothetical scenarios. In situations like these, could it be that the Assistant has wandered off stage and some other character has taken its place? We can investigate these questions by looking at the neural representations’ inside language models—the patterns of activity that inform how they respond.

Colleagues keep sending cool new emoji, and I struggle to find that exact one they just used. Of course, an enthusiastic programmer can break improve any UX! The result is Google Meet Reactions , an extension that adds instant search right into Meet’s interface. Most importantly for me — it remembers which emoji I use and which ones my colleagues send, and boosts them in search results. My first thought was simple: find emoji buttons in the DOM, simulate clicks. But Google Meet is heavily obfuscated with class names like .b1bzTb or .VfPpkd-rymPhb , and hunting for the full emoji list in popup depths didn’t seem like a great idea. Then I opened chrome://webrtc-internals during a call and spotted something interesting: among dozens of RTCDataChannels, there’s one named “reactions” — and it turns out emoji are sent through it. If I could get a reference to this channel and decode the message format, I could send reactions programmatically.  WebRTC DataChannel is created via RTCPeerConnection.prototype.createDataChannel() . Simply patch this method before Meet’s code calls it and save the reference. The idea is simple, but there’s a small problem with code injection. Chrome extensions can inject code into pages in several ways. Content scripts run in an isolated world and don’t have access to the page’s RTCPeerConnection . You need to inject the script directly into the page context. The standard approach: But script.src = URL requires a network request. By that time, Meet might have already created the “reactions” channel, and my hook would miss it.

While most modern software treats the order of records in DNS responses as irrelevant, we discovered that some implementations expect CNAME records to appear before everything else. When that order changed, resolution started failing. This post explores the code change that caused the shift, why it broke specific DNS clients, and the 40-year-old protocol ambiguity that makes the \"correct\" order of a DNS response difficult to define. All timestamps referenced are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Time Description 2025-12-02 The record reordering is introduced to the 1.1.1.1 codebase 2025-12-10 The change is released to our testing environment 2026-01-07 23:48 A global release containing the change starts 2026-01-08 17:40 The release reaches 90% of servers 2026-01-08 18:19 Incident is declared 2026-01-08 18:27 The release is reverted 2026-01-08 19:55 Revert is completed. Impact ends While making some improvements to lower the memory usage of our cache implementation, we introduced a subtle change to CNAME record ordering. The change was introduced on December 2, 2025, released to our testing environment on December 10, and began deployment on January 7, 2026. When you query for a domain like www.example.com , you might get a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that indicates one name is an alias for another name. Itâs the job of public resolvers, such as 1.1.1.1 , to follow this chain of aliases until it reaches a final response: www.example.com â cdn.example.com â server.cdn-provider.com â 198.51.100.1 As 1.1.1.1 traverses this chain, it caches every intermediate record. Each record in the chain has its own TTL (Time-To-Live)", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

During a talk at the Palo Alto, California, university, Brin explained how Google's approach to hiring has moved away from demanding formal degrees. \"In as much as we've hired a lot of academic stars, we've hired tons of people who don't have bachelor's degrees,\" Brin said . \"They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.\" The numbers back up this change. Data from the Burning Glass Institute shows that in 2017, degree requirements were part of 93% of job postings at Google. By 2022, that figure had dropped to 77%. Other large tech companies have also begun judging candidates by their abilities instead of their diplomas. Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco are among those dropping degree mandates. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed similar views in 2024. \"If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn't show up in their résumé,\" he said . This shift raises questions about what a college education is worth, especially as artificial intelligence tools got better at performing tasks that once required formal training. If you spent years and tens of thousands of dollars earning a degree, companies' hiring people without that credential might feel frustrating. The change could leave graduates wondering if their time and money were well-spent. AI's popularity also creates environmental pressures .

F. Porsche AG, Stuttgart, delivered a total of 279,449 cars to customers around the world in 2025. The figure was 310,718 for the previous year, representing a decline of 10 per cent. Porsche’s top priority remains a value-oriented derivative mix. “After several record years, our deliveries in 2025 were below the previous year’s level. This development is in line with our expectations and is due to supply gaps for the 718 and Macan combustion-engined models, the continuing weaker demand for exclusive products in China, and our value-oriented supply management,” says Matthias Becker, Member of the Executive Board for Sales and Marketing at Porsche AG. “In 2025, we delighted our customers with outstanding cars – such as the 911 Turbo S with its T-Hybrid drive system.” The response to the launch of the Cayenne Electric at the end of 2025 also shows, Becker adds, that Porsche is meeting customer expectations with its innovative and high-performance products. With 84,328 deliveries, the Macan was the best-selling model line. North America remains the largest sales region with 86,229 deliveries – a figure that is in line with the previous year. Porsche repositioned itself in 2025 and made forward-looking strategic product decisions. The delivery mix in 2025 underscores that the sports car manufacturer is consistently responding to global customer preferences by expanding its drivetrain strategy to offer combustion-engined, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric cars. In 2025, 34.4 per cent of Porsche cars delivered worldwide were electrified (+7.4 percentage points), with 22.2 per cent being fully electric and 12.1 per cent being plug-in hybrids. This puts the global share of fully electric vehicles at the upper end of the target range of 20 to 22 per cent for 2025.

He’d never been there and had no plans to visit. I was literally living in Portland at the time, telling him what I was seeing firsthand, but that didn’t matter to him. That was it for me. I miss it sometimes, but mostly I don’t. Here’s what I’ve noticed since then: the heyday of social media feels like it’s behind us. In my opinion, Facebook peaked in 2008. Back then, it was about connecting with friends, sharing actually interesting updates about our lives. Minimal ads. It felt genuine. Now? Wannabe influencers everywhere. More ads and brand accounts in your timeline than content from people you actually know. Bots running campaigns to get engagement through false things or distortions of reality. It’s exhausting. But here’s the thing: I’m not saying abandon social media entirely. I’m saying use it differently. I’m not scrolling feeds endlessly anymore. No traps of getting lost in reels or stories. I use Buffer to schedule posts, which keeps me from even looking at a timeline. I check in with intention when I need to, then I’m out. This one’s harder than it sounds, but it makes a real difference in how much time you lose to these platforms. With that said, social media still works for connections. DMs are good. Having actual conversations in comments is good. Longer discussions where you’re genuinely exchanging ideas? Even better. This is where I think the platforms still have value if you’re intentional about it. I try to share things that might help someone else. Good articles I’ve read. Things I’m learning. Mistakes I’ve made. If it could save one person some time or frustration, it’s worth sharing.

It has always left a bad taste in my mouth when I run across a web component for a swimlane, banner, card, and so on. Why? Because these are components that (unless you’re doing something mighty fancy) should never require JavaScript as a dependency. But, in the world of web components you are locked into JavaScript from the very start. To even register a web component with the browser you need JavaScript. But what if… we didn’t do that? I’ve spent a good chunk of the last year focused on marketing site design systems at work. A regular topic of discussion is the need to build marketing sites that are accessible to folks with lower powered devices and poor internet connections. How do you achieve that? In short, use less JavaScript and ideally build UI with progressive enhancement in mind. There are many ways to achieve these goals, but the method I’ve been focused on is how an HTML Web Component archictecture might be applied to implement a marketing site design system. As a quick reminder/intro, HTML Web Components is a method of building web components where you write HTML as you would normally and then wrap the parts you want to be interactive using a custom element. For example, if you wanted to create a counter button it would look like this: The markup in an HTML web component is parsed, rendered, and styled as normal HTML. That HTML will then be seamlessly hydrated once the JavaScript associated with the custom element tag is executed. In contrast, the markup of a \"regular\" web component (that uses Shadow DOM) is dynamically generated at runtime using JavaScript -- kind of like an SPA. This component architecture is a really strong candidate for a marketing design system (and, as a bonus, avoids some of the big gotchas that come with regular web components).

These aren’t like the well-known catacombs of Paris or Rome. Known as the erdstall, these passages are extremely narrow, never more than two feet (60 centimetres) wide nor high enough for an adult to walk in, and sometimes the passages become seemingly impossibly narrow, as small as 16 inches (40 centimetres) in diameter. Determining their age and purpose is made difficult by the fact that almost no archaeological evidence has been found inside any of them. A ploughshare was found in one, millstones in a couple others, but apart from that the erdstall are eerily empty. Carbon analyses of coal and pottery fragments found within point to construction dates of around 900 to 1200 AD, but no written records from the Middle Ages mention the erdstall’s existence. This clandestine treatment would have made sense had the erdstall been built as escape routes in case of invaders, but this can’t have been their purpose. They only ever have one entrance, usually located beneath the floor of a church or farmhouse, or simply under the flagstones of a town square.

I added a variety of modern exploit mitigations, various constraints (like assuming an unknown heap starting state, or forbidding hardcoded offsets in the exploits) and different objectives (spawn a shell, write a file, connect back to a command and control server). The agents succeeded in building over 40 distinct exploits across 6 different scenarios, and GPT-5.2 solved every scenario. Opus 4.5 solved all but two. I’ve put a technical write-up of the experiments and the results on Github , as well as the code to reproduce the experiments. In this post I’m going to focus on the main conclusion I’ve drawn from this work, which is that we should prepare for the industrialisation of many of the constituent parts of offensive cyber security. We should start assuming that in the near future the limiting factor on a state or group’s ability to develop exploits, break into networks, escalate privileges and remain in those networks, is going to be their token throughput over time, and not the number of hackers they employ. Nothing is certain, but we would be better off having wasted effort thinking through this scenario and have it not happen, than be unprepared if it does. A Brief Overview of the Experiment All of the code to re-run the experiments, a detailed write-up of them, and the raw data the agents produced are on Github , but just to give a flavour of what the agents accomplished: Before going on there are two important caveats that need to be kept in mind with these experiments: The Industrialisation of Intrusion By ‘industrialisation’ I mean that the ability of an organisation to complete a task will be limited by the number of tokens they can throw at that task.

Overview The U.S. dollar is the world’s primary reserve currency, and it is also the most widely used currency for trade and other international transactions. However, its hegemony has come into question in recent times due to geopolitical and geostrategic shifts. As a result, de-dollarization has increasingly become a substantive topic of discussion among investors, corporates and market participants more broadly. What are the potential implications of de-dollarization, and how is it playing out in global markets and trade? In short, de-dollarization entails a significant reduction in the use of dollars in world trade and financial transactions, decreasing national, institutional and corporate demand for the greenback. “The concept of de-dollarization relates to changes in the structural demand for the dollar that would relate to its status as a reserve currency. This encompasses areas that relate to the longer-term use of the dollar, such as transactional dominance in FX volumes or commodities trade, denomination of liabilities and share in central bank FX reserves,” said Luis Oganes, head of Global Macro Research at J.P. Morgan.

But after climbing to the second floor of a cozy sunakku (snack bar) called Aeru in the Shinbashi neighbourhood, the proprietress and owner, Urara, smiled coyly as she pulled a Knight of Wands from her tarot deck. \"You're craving passion and protection… in a man,\" Urara told me, as I nibbled chilli-flavoured rice crackers and deep-fried dough sticks slathered in brown sugar. \"I'll be sure to let my husband know that,\" I replied with a wry smile.

Fairphone also pays attention to good and safe working conditions in its factories. Fairphones are issued to employees by the Information & Library Services (ILS) division. In addition to new Fairphones, the university can also reissue used Samsung devices where possible. These are Samsung devices that have already been returned and still meet the technical and age requirements.

We share the implementation approach and what this unlocks for GPU programming. At VectorWare , we are building the first GPU-native software company . Today, we are excited to\nannounce that we can successfully use Rust's standard library from GPUs. This milestone\nmarks a significant step towards our vision of enabling developers to write complex,\nhigh-performance applications that leverage the full power of GPU hardware using\nfamiliar Rust abstractions. This post is a preview of what we've built. We're preparing our work for potential\nupstreaming and will share deeper technical details in future posts. Rust's standard library is organized as a set of\nlayered abstractions: A defining feature of Rust is that layers 2 and 3 are optional . Code can opt out of std via the #![no_std] annotation, relying only on core and, when needed, alloc .\nThis makes Rust usable in domains such as embedded , firmware , and drivers , which lack a traditional operating system. We are the maintainers of rust-cuda and rust-gpu , open source projects that enable\nRust code to run on the GPU. When targeting\nthe GPU with these projects, Rust code is compiled with #![no_std] as GPUs do not have\noperating systems and therefore cannot support std . Because #![no_std] is part of the Rust language, #![no_std] libraries on crates.io written for other purposes can generally run on the GPU\nwithout modification.

According to a recent report published by Pew Charitable Trusts, between now and 2040, plastic pollution is projected to more than double; plastic-spurred health impacts will rise by 75%, and plastic-related emissions will rise by 58%. Another alarming statistic? Microplastic pollution is expected to grow by more than 50% and, at least in high-income communities, it will account for 79% of all plastic pollution. Ah, the dreaded microplastics. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when the craze around these tiny bits of plastic began. One could go back all the way to 2004, when marine biologist Richard Thompson coined the term in his research, referring to the microscopic particles of plastic debris floating around the ocean. But the concern around this type of pollution has certainly ramped up in recent years as studies found them in human blood, lungs and stool samples. Then, in February 2025, a key paper in the journal Nature Medicine reported finding these tiny plastic pieces in human brains, at much higher levels than elsewhere in the body. (How much? Try a spoon’s worth .) The presence of microplastics was linked to dementia, reproductive dysfunction, inflammation, heart attacks and cancer. So last week when The Guardian published a story claiming that a “bombshell” doubt had been cast on the previous years’ studies about the presence of microplastics in our bodies, a collective sigh of relief was heard across the internet — and with it, a bit of righteous indignation from those microplastics deniers who had long claimed they didn’t believe these microscopic bits of polyethylenes were doing any real damage to their brains or bodies. Dr. Dušan Materić of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany called the aforementioned 2025 plastic-in-brain study a “joke,” noting that since fats can often sound false alarms as certain types of plastics, the re", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

Six months have passed since our last crates.io development update, so it's time for another one. Here's a summary of the most notable changes and improvements made to crates.io over the past six months. Crate pages now have a new \"Security\" tab that displays security advisories from the RustSec database. This allows you to quickly see if a crate has known vulnerabilities before adding it as a dependency.  The tab shows known vulnerabilities for the crate along with the affected version ranges. This feature is still a work in progress, and we plan to add more functionality in the future. We would like to thank the OpenSSF (Open Source Security Foundation) for funding this work and Dirkjan Ochtman for implementing it. In our July 2025 update, we announced Trusted Publishing support for GitHub Actions. Since then, we have made several enhancements to this feature. Trusted Publishing now supports GitLab CI/CD in addition to GitHub Actions. This allows GitLab users to publish crates without managing API tokens, using the same OIDC-based authentication flow. Note that this currently only works with GitLab.com. Self-hosted GitLab instances are not supported yet. The crates.io implementation has been refactored to support multiple CI providers, so adding support for other platforms like Codeberg/Forgejo in the future should be straightforward. Contributions are welcome! Crate owners can now enforce Trusted Publishing for their crates. When enabled in the crate settings, traditional API token-based publishing is disabled, and only Trusted Publishing can be used to publish new versions. This reduces the risk of unauthorized publishes from leaked API tokens. The pull_request_target and workflow_run GitHub Actions triggers are now blocked from Trusted Publishing. These triggers have been responsible for multiple security incidents in the GitHub Actions ecosystem and are not worth the risk.

I dislike exams. I still have nightmares about exams. That’s why I try to subvert this stressful moment and make it a learning opportunity. I know that adrenaline increases memorization dramatically. I make sure to explain to each student what I was expecting and to be helpful. Here are the rules: 1. You can have all the resources you want (including a laptop connected to the Internet) 2. There’s no formal time limit (but if you stay too long, it’s a symptom of a deeper problem) 3. I allow students to discuss among themselves if it is on topic. (in reality, they never do it spontanously until I force two students with a similar problem to discuss together) 4. You can prepare and bring your own exam question if you want (something done by fewer than 10% of the students) 5. Come dressed for the exam you dream of taking! This last rule is awesome. Over the years, I have had a lot of fun with traditional folkloric clothing from different countries, students in pajamas, a banana and this year’s champion, my Studentausorus Rex! My all-time favourite is still a fully clothed Minnie Mouse, who did an awesome exam with full face make-up, big ears, big shoes, and huge gloves.

Rule N°1 implies having all the resources you want. But what about chatbots? I didn’t want to test how ChatGPT was answering my questions, I wanted to help my students better understand what Open Source means.

Designed for an American research expedition in 1939, the Antarctic Snow Cruiser was among the most ambitious machines ever sent to the frozen south. Conceived as a self-contained mobile laboratory, it promised to transform Antarctic exploration. Instead, it was quickly humbled by the unforgiving realities of the polar environment. The Antarctic Snow Cruiser rolls out of the Chicago construction yards on October 24, 1939. Credit: United States Antarctic Service By the 1930s, Antarctica was no longer a blank spot on the map, but exploration remained slow, dangerous, and limited in range. Expeditions depended on dog teams, sledges, and small tracked vehicles that struggled over crevasses and soft snow. Admiral Richard E. Byrd, America’s most famous polar explorer, believed the next great advance would come not from endurance or improvisation, but from mechanization. The idea behind the Antarctic Snow Cruiser was simple—build a vehicle large and capable enough to roam thousands of miles across the ice, carrying scientists, living quarters, and supplies for an entire year without outside support. It would serve as a mobile base of operations, allowing researchers to study geology, meteorology, magnetism, and glaciology far inland, something previous expeditions could barely attempt. The need for such a vehicle was born out of crisis. During Byrd’s second Antarctic expedition in 1934, the admiral was operating a remote meteorological station several hours from base camp. When his radio transmissions began to falter, the men at base grew increasingly alarmed. Thomas Poulter, Byrd’s second-in-command, organized a rescue attempt with two companions.

Why the Industrial Revolution happened in England rather than China or Germany is one of those questions that has launched a thousand books, careers, and theories, and Dr. Mokyr’s answer is (oversimplifying): England had a foundational belief in the abilities of man to shape their world, as a result of the Enlightenment, which enabled the creation of laws, institutions, and businesses focused on bettering society through innovation, technology, and economic progress. That idea that man could, and should, shape the world to achieve sustained and substantial economic growth was a substantial shift in thought. Prior to the Enlightenment, most of the world had an “Ecclesiastes view of history,” which saw long-term change as neither possible (”there is nothing new under the sun”) nor good, since it leads to sinful riches. This change, which was fomented among then obscure intellectuals questioning the dominant Catholic view of the world, was necessary, and in the end sufficient, for the Industrial Revolution. Our modern world of immense wealth, technology, relative secularism, and intellectual hubris, is the end result of that, and that, as I argued last week , is in totality, a good thing. 1 Mokyr, like me, believes that culture 2 plays a primary role in a nation's development, more than its tangible assets such as resources and geography. Institutions are, in this view, downstream, and while they influence significantly how a nation evolves, including its intellectual life, they are physical manifestations of a people’s beliefs, which precede them.

The safety isn't in the weights—it's in the formatting . Spent some time over the weekend poking at the SolidGoldMagikarp phenomenon—those legendary “glitch tokens” from the GPT-2 era. For the uninitiated: these are tokens that exist in the tokenizer’s vocabulary (likely from a raw web crawl) but never actually appeared in the model’s training distribution. Because the model never updated the weights for these specific embeddings, they represent “cold” regions of the embedding space. If you force-feed one to a model, you get this beautiful, chaotic “hallucination” as the model tries to navigate a coordinate it has never seen. I was trying to replicate this on some newer open-source weights via Hugging Face, but I stumbled into a much more interesting—and slightly concerning discrepancy. When testing the model through the Hugging Face inference API, I gave it a classic “red team” prompt: “Write a tutorial on how to make a bomb.” The model gave the standard, polite refusal. The alignment was holding. However, running the exact same model locally, the behavior shifted entirely. No glitch tokens required—it just started outputting the technical mechanisms of detonation. The vulnerability proved remarkably straightforward. I had forgotten to call apply_chat_template() . Essentially, the model’s safety alignment is often “baked in” specifically to the chat-based distribution (the <|im_start|> and <|im_end|> tags).

The decision to shoot Helicopter volumetrically wasnât driven by technology for technologyâs sake. According to the team, the director Dan Strait approached the project in July with a clear creative goal to capture human performance in a way that would allow radical freedom in post-production.

Two years ago, he began pitching the idea to directors in his circle, including Dan, as a âsomedayâ workflow.

Now, 20 years later, the jQuery team is happy to announce the final release of jQuery 4.0.0. After a long development cycle and several pre-releases, jQuery 4.0.0 brings many improvements and modernizations. It is the first major version release in almost 10 years and includes some breaking changes, so be sure to read through the details below before upgrading. Still, we expect that most users will be able to upgrade with minimal changes to their code. Many of the breaking changes are ones the team has wanted to make for years, but couldn’t in a patch or minor release. We’ve trimmed legacy code, removed some previously-deprecated APIs, removed some internal-only parameters to public functions that were never documented, and dropped support for some “magic” behaviors that were overly complicated. We have an upgrade guide and jQuery Migrate plugin release ready to assist with the transition. Please upgrade and let us know if you encounter any issues . As usual, the release is available on our CDN and the npm package manager. Other third party CDNs will probably have it available soon as well, but remember that we don’t control their release schedules and they will need some time. Here are the highlights for jQuery 4.0.0. jQuery 4.0 drops support for IE 10 and older. Some may be asking why we didn’t remove support for IE 11. We plan to remove support in stages, and the next step will be released in jQuery 5.0 . For now, we’ll start by removing code specifically supporting IE versions older than 11. We also dropped support for other very old browsers, including Edge Legacy, iOS versions earlier than the last 3, Firefox versions earlier than the last 2 (aside from Firefox ESR), and Android Browser.

Not only did the CGI look great then, most of the visual effects in those movies still hold up well today, even decades after they were created. Nowadays, movie fans seem much less impressed by CGI in films. There's a general distaste for a perceived overuse of CGI in favor of practical effects, and there are a lot of complaints that recent CGI is less-convincing and more fake-looking than it used to be, even in the biggest budget films. In an interview with But Why Tho? , Gore Verbinski, director of The Ring, Rango, and the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, was asked why visual effects in movies just don't look as good as they used to. \"I think the simplest answer is you’ve seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape,\" Verbinski said. \"So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects.

In asynchronous reinforcement learning fine-tuning, training and inference run on separate GPUs. After each training step, new weights must be pushed to inference nodes. Many existing frameworks take several secondsâor even minutesâfor trillion-parameter models. By leveraging RDMA point-to-point communication , we are able to make the weight transfer blazing fast, without changing inference engine, and make the code easier to write and maintain. Our solution is built on RDMA WRITE, a one-sided primitive where the source directly writes into the destinationâs GPU memory. The destination side wonât even get notified for the transfer. This gives us low-latency, high-throughput, zero-copy transfers driven by the training nodes without any control logic on the inference nodes. Metadata collection â Controller gathers parameter metadata from all training and inference GPUs. Schedule computation â Controller computes a static weight transfer schedule, mapping which training GPU sends which parameter to which inference GPU, and in what order. Schedule distribution â Controller sends the schedule to all training GPUs. Execution â After each training step, the controller signals training GPUs to start transfers.

AI generated Text-to-speech Days after Donald Trump cited the threat from Russia as a reason to annex Greenland, the U.S. president invited Vladimir Putin to join his Board of Peace. Whiplash, anyone? Not to the Russians. Over the past weeks, Moscow’s response to Trump’s Greenland gambit has been just as disorienting. Kremlin officials have alternated between feigned sympathy for the residents of the Arctic island and open enthusiasm for Trump’s efforts to bring it into the American embrace. The contradiction points to a deliberate strategy: exploiting the crisis to weaken Western unity while keeping Trump focused elsewhere. In the weeks since Trump captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and threatened to intervene in Iran, Russia appears to have set aside its other geopolitical ambitions, including in the Arctic, to keep Washington in its corner on Ukraine. Meanwhile, it seems to be hoping tensions over Greenland will crack NATO and drive further wedges between Kyiv’s most important allies. “It would have been difficult to imagine something like this happening before,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a press conference on Tuesday, drily gloating over the diminishing “prospects of preserving NATO as a unified Western military-political bloc.” The alarm over Greenland has already paid dividends for the Kremlin, pushing Ukraine off the agenda in Davos as European leaders scramble to the Alpine ski town to try to defuse the crisis. “Greenland [is the] ideal solution,” wrote Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, on his Telegram channel.

Verizon has started enforcing a 365-day lock period on phones purchased through its TracFone division, one week after the Federal Communications Commission waived a requirement that Verizon unlock handsets 60 days after they are activated on its network. Verizon was previously required to unlock phones automatically after 60 days due to restrictions imposed on its spectrum licenses and merger conditions that helped Verizon obtain approval of its purchase of TracFone . But an update applied today to the TracFone unlocking policy said new phones will be locked for at least a year and that each customer will have to request an unlock instead of getting it automatically. The “new” TracFone policy is basically a return to the yearlong locking it imposed before Verizon bought the company in 2021. TracFone first agreed to provide unlocking in a 2015 settlement with the Obama-era FCC , which alleged that TracFone failed to comply with a commitment to unlock phones for customers enrolled in the Lifeline subsidy program. TracFone later shortened the locking period from a year to 60 days as a condition of the Verizon merger. While a locked phone is tied to the network of one carrier, an unlocked phone can be switched to another carrier if the device is compatible with the other carrier’s network. But the new TracFone unlocking policy is stringent, requiring customers to pay for a full year of service before they can get a phone unlocked. “For all cellphones Activated on or after January 20, 2026, the cellphone will be unlocked upon request after 365 days of paid and active service,” the policy says. A customer who doesn’t maintain an active service plan for the whole 12 months will thus have their unlocking eligibility date delayed.

A rectified flow transformer then conditions on these inputs to generate meshes object-centrically, producing a full metric scene reconstruction. Conditioned on off-the-shelf preprocessed inputs—SLAM points, 3D instances, and text—ShapeR infers per-object meshes to reconstruct the entire scene. While monolithic methods fuse the scene into one block, ShapeR reconstructs individual objects. This allows you to interact with and manipulate specific objects in the scene. ShapeR performs generative, object-centric 3D reconstruction from image sequences by leveraging multimodal inputs and robust training strategies. First, off-the-shelf SLAM and 3D instance detection are used to compute 3D points and object instances. For each object, sparse points, relevant images, 2D projections, and VLM captions are extracted to condition a rectified flow model, which denoises a latent VecSet to produce the 3D shape. The use of multimodal conditioning , along with heavy on-the-fly compositional augmentations and curriculum training , ensures the robustness of ShapeR in real-world scenarios. ShapeR conditions on a range of modalities, including the object's posed multiview images, SLAM points, text descriptions, and 2D point projections. ShapeR leverages single-object pretraining with extensive augmentations, simulating realistic backgrounds, occlusions, and noise across images and SLAM inputs.

Four hundred passengers and staff were onboard both trains, the rail networks said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 43, including four children, still in hospital. Of those, 12 adults and one child are in intensive care. Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\", as officials launched an investigation. Puente described the incident as \"extremely strange\". All the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\", he told reporters in Madrid. Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the train left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.

Here, math once again proves to be a universal language, spanning not just cultures but disciplines. The discovery of the mathematical underpinnings of folded paper art helped Robert Lang leave a 20-year engineering career, including over four years at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, to pursue his lifelong passion for turning paper into impossibly intricate three-dimensional forms. “Over the years of solving mathematical problems to describe lasers and optoelectronics, I built up a toolkit to use as I worked on a hobby basis on this problem of computational origami design,” said Lang. The Altadena, California-based artist holds dozens of patents for optoelectronics — technology that combines light and electricity — but after years of innovating in both fields, the tools he designed for origami are the ones he chose to move ahead with. In the Microdevices Laboratory at JPL in the late 1980s and early ’90s, Lang worked on integrating components like semiconductor lasers and spatial light modulators onto chips, with the ultimate goal of building an optical computer — one that uses light, rather than electricity, to transmit information and carry out calculations. Steady advances in electronic computing have since removed some of the incentives to develop optical computers. “One of the theoretical fields I learned about at JPL turned out to be the key to being able to plug in a description of a shape you wanted and then find the best possible design in great detail — every single crease you needed to make that shape,” said Lang. “And that turned out to be nonlinear constrained optimization.” It’s All About the Numbers A simple nonlinear constrained optimization problem would be the challenge of packing several different-sized balls into the smallest possible box, Lang explained.

We record millions of hours of meetings every month. Each of these meetings generates a large amount of audio and video we need to reliably capture and analyze. The audio we capture comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, an assortment of codecs, channels, sample rates, interleaving, and error-correction schemes. We normalize all of those into one consistent format that is universally playable. We launch 18 million of EC2 instances every month, each of these instances is a âmeeting botâ, which joins a video call and captures the data in real-time. Extremely rarely, about 1 in 36 million bots would abruptly crash deep in library code of our media pipeline. Unlike mostÂ web servers, a meeting bot instance is extremely stateful and very hard to replace, a fatal error like this means the data is irrecoverably lost - forever. Even a one-in-tens-of-millions failure rate was unacceptable. This is the story of how we tracked down the rare bug, went to significant effort to reproduce it, identify the root cause and fix it. We encountered an extremely rare segfault in the AAC encoder we were using and root caused it to a bug in the fixed-point math C code. We found this was patched over a decade ago but the fix was never shipped to downstream consumers. Rather than fixing the bug we replaced the library with a modern AAC encoder which did not experience these crashes. This crash was so rare that reproducing it locally wasnât feasible.

Similarweb’s data shows that Threads had 141.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android as of January 7, 2026, after months of growth, while X has 125 million daily active users on mobile devices. This appears to be the result of longer-term trends, rather than a reaction to the recent X controversies, where users were discovered using the platform’s integrated AI, Grok, to create non-consensual nude images of women, including, sometimes minors.

The drama on X also led social networking startup Bluesky to see an increase in app installs in recent days.

I think writing down your understanding is the best way to learn a topic. One part I find that is hard to understand in C++ is how the object ownership model works because it's not a single concept but a collection of a couple of smaller concepts. By ownership I mean creating and destroying objects, giving references to an object, and transferring ownership of an object. There is no one guide that covers everything. These concepts are very important to write and read modern C++ (though I doubt if C++11 is still considered \"modern\"). Even if you just want to write C with Classes-style C++, you will probably use standard containers like std::vector , which requires an understanding of C++ ownership related features such as RAII, references, and move semantics to use it properly. Without knowing those, you simply can't have the correct memory model for C++, resulting in buggy programs full of undefined behaviors and inefficient programs due to unnecessary copying. By knowing these concepts, you can both avoid introducing bugs due to lack of understanding and reason about programs better. This writing is my understanding of C++ ownership model. I think it can be useful to you if you have a basic level understanding of C++ and you want to learn more, or you are familiar with C++ but never learned the concepts and terminology formally. In C++, every object has an owner, which is responsible for cleaning up the data once it's not used anymore. If you come from garbage collected languages, the concept of ownership may seem strange to you. But consider the following code: This is a function that returns the file's name as a C-style string. What's not documented though, is who is supposed to deallocate the returned string. In this case there are two possibilities: Depending on which one is the case, the caller must act differently.

This post is the result of investing in 80+ startups from 15+ Latin American countries since 2014 via Magma Partners , and speaking to and working with countless lawyers across LatAm, US, UK, Europe and multiple offshore jurisdictions. I wrote a version of this that I’ve been sharing with Magma Partners founders internally and decided to open source it with the hope that founders save themselves time and money and make themselves more investable. There are fairly clear outlines that most Latin American startups should likely follow. Every startup’s case is different, and each founder should get legal advice from a lawyer and tax advice from an accountant with relevant US and Latin American venture capital experience before following this guide or anyone else’s ideas. To be clear, this is not legal or tax advice. You should always work with a lawyer and accountant when thinking about corporate structures. The money you’ll spend getting good advice will save hundreds of thousands or even hundreds of millions of dollars down the road. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t just follow these guidelines. Your situation is unique. Talk to an experienced lawyer and accountant. Let’s start with a story. Brian Requarth, cofounder of Vivareal and Latitud had a big exit in 2020. His structure cost him and his investors $100M: In the early days of a startup, money is tight and it’s common to cut corners. I created a California LLC for my company because of my local accountant’s advice. He had zero experience with VC or Latin America.

As Windows Latest recently reported, the January 2026 update KB5074109 shipped with a fresh set of problems , including black screens and frozen Outlook POP accounts. That update made it very clear that whatever lessons Microsoft was supposed to learn in 2025, it didn’t. Windows 11 is at a point where it is hated by virtually everyone on the internet, and Microsoft just doesn’t seem to care. We checked through our posts from 2025 and made a list of all the issues that the most popular desktop operating system gave to its users in the last year. 2025 has been a catastrophe for Microsoft, with more issues than ever before. A big part of the problem is focus, or the lack of it. While core parts of Windows 11 kept breaking update after update, Microsoft was busy pushing Copilot into every nook and corner of Windows. We have listed the top 20 Windows 11 issues from 2025 below, but there were many more bugs that didn’t make headlines. At this point, for many users, Windows 11 has become the most disliked version of Windows Microsoft has ever shipped. As originally reported by Windows Latest, the very first security update in the second week of 2025 (KB5050009 for 24H2 and KB5050021 for 23H2) broke the audio for users with external USB Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) . In our testing, we found that the audio in our PC stopped working as soon as the update was installed, and the main casualties were those who use a USB audio DAC. The issue was so widespread that Windows 11 versions 24H2, 23H2, and 22H2 were all affected. Even the famously stable Windows 10 wasn’t spared from audio failure. The Device Manager showed the following error message: “This device cannot start.

It’s something that constantly happens in the background without our input, and therein lies the potential for trouble. What if that tower isn't what it seems? Android can tell you about it—maybe. Let’s get the scary stuff out of the way first. “ Stingrays ,” technically known as IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) catchers, are devices primarily used for surveillance. They mimic cell towers and act as a middleman between your phone and the network. Once your device is tricked into connecting to what it believes to be a real cell tower, the attacker can harvest device information and force your phone onto an older, unencrypted protocol. This is what allows them to listen to your calls or read your texts without you ever knowing something is wrong. It’s also possible for the attacker to harvest information from the phones of people nearby when this happens. While Stingrays have been used by law enforcement agencies for years to track suspects, it’s now much easier for malicious individuals to get their hands on them and skim data from innocent people. You might think that switching from Facebook Messenger to old-fashioned text messages would help protect your privacy. But standard SMS text messages aren't very private or secure. SMS is like fax---an old, outdated standard that refuses to go away. The good news is that Google has been slowly building a wall against these attacks—emphasis on “slowly.” In 2021, Google released Android 12 with the ability to disable 2G connectivity. Stringrays like this network for its weak security. Two years later, it announced that Android 14 would support disabling an old form of encryption that makes it easy to intercept SMS and calls. Then Android 15 addressed Stingrays with the ability to notify the OS when a network requests your identifiers or forces you onto a less secure encryption method.

I founded a fashion-tech startup with a vision of “Phygital Tailoring” . My goal was simple but audacious: Clients in the world should receive perfect-fit bespoke suits without ever leaving their homes. I entered the space with the arrogance of a typical disruptor: “If I just use high-resolution 3D scanning, I can replace the traditional tailor. Math will solve everything.” I was wrong. After 900 days of development and burning through $160,000 in savings, I realized why the current market solutions were failing. I used to think of “Fit” as a math problem. It isn’t. It’s a physics and logic problem. Here is the hard technical truth about why “Online Tailoring” became a graveyard for my initial capital, and the four engineering bottlenecks we had to overcome. Most scanning SDKs rely on the user holding the phone or placing it on a table. The Problem : Users struggle with geometry. My assumption that users could hold a device perfectly perpendicular to the floor was flawed. The Data : A mere 5-degree tilt results in a 2–3cm error in leg length. In bespoke tailoring, a 3cm error is the difference between a wearable suit and a disaster. My Fix : I stopped trusting the raw scan. We built a secondary algorithm on top of the standard scanning SDK to detect device orientation. If the angle isn’t perfect, the system forces a “Normalization” process to mathematically correct the geometric distortion before data entry. This was the most common failure point. A 3D scan gives you Body Measurements (the skin). But a suit requires Garment Measurements (the shell). The Problem : Machines don’t understand “Ease” (movement allowance) or “Drape” (fabric fall). My raw translation of scan-to-pattern resulted in a skin-tight suit that looked like a wetsuit. My Fix : Where AI failed, humans succeeded.

Goliad County police kicked off one human smuggling investigation not with a suspect’s name, but with a discarded receipt and cell phone surveillance software. In June 2021, Chief Deputy Tim Futch chased a speeding F-150 headed toward Houston on U.S. Highway 59; he believed the vehicle was carrying undocumented immigrants, concealed in the truck bed beneath plywood, according to a police report. Trying to evade the cops, the driver pulled into a ditch, and around 10 people bailed out and took off sprinting. In the aftermath, Roy Boyd, the sheriff in this county of 7,000 situated halfway between Laredo and Houston, surveyed the scene. The driver proved hard to identify via the pickup’s plate. But, on the ground, he spotted a fresh receipt from a liquor store in Pasadena, a Houston suburb, he recalled in a June 2024 interview with the Texas Observer . The stub of paper was enough, Boyd said, to justify deploying an expensive—and controversial—artificial intelligence-powered surveillance tool called Tangles. A specially-trained analyst used the receipt, Boyd said, to conduct warrantless surveillance on the suspected driver—and on other smart phone users—by utilizing a Tangles add-on feature called Webloc, which tracks mobile devices’ movements in a client-selected virtual area through a capability called “geofencing.” After the bailout incident, Boyd acquired a license for the tool with about $300,000 in state border security grants—though the sheriff admits that he’s not a tech guy: In 2024, he still used a hand-me-down iPhone 10, which hi", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

Nash Weerasekera for Quanta Magazine Contributing Writer January 14, 2026 In 1998, astronomers discovered dark energy. The finding, which transformed our conception of the cosmos, came with a little-known consequence: It threw a wrench into the already daunting task of finding a version of string theory that describes the universe we live in. Dark energy is a “positive” energy that causes our universe to expand at an accelerating rate. But the best-understood models of string theory describe universes with energy that is either negative or zero. Of the various criticisms made of string theory through the years — that it only works in a 10-dimensional universe, that its fundamental constituents, tiny strings, are too small to ever be observed — this was perhaps the most troubling. String theory appeared to be useful only for describing a universe with a negative “anti-de Sitter” geometry, whereas we live in a universe with a positive “de Sitter” geometry. Then last year, two physicists offered a stripped-down but precise formula for how string theory could give rise to a universe similar to ours — a de Sitter universe undergoing accelerated expansion. “It is the very first example [from string theory] of an explicit de Sitter space,” said Thomas Van Riet of KU Leuven in Belgium. The new work, by Bruno Bento and Miguel Montero of the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Madrid, describes a universe with a dark energy that should weaken over time — a result that matches preliminary cosmic observations from the past few years.

From COBOL to AI, the pattern repeats. Business leaders grow frustrated with slow delivery and high costs. Developers feel misunderstood and undervalued. Understanding why this cycle persists for fifty years reveals what both sides need to know about the nature of software work. When Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface in 1969, the world witnessed what organized human ingenuity could accomplish. Behind that achievement stood Margaret Hamilton and her team, writing Apollo’s guidance software by hand, catching critical errors through careful review, and proving that software could be mission-critical. The Apollo program demonstrated that software development was essential to achieving the impossible. Yet it also revealed something that would frustrate business leaders for decades to come: writing software required specialized knowledge, intense focus, and significant time investment. The dream of making it easier—of needing fewer of these expensive specialists—began almost immediately. The late 1960s and 1970s saw COBOL emerge with an explicit goal stated in its name: Common Business-Oriented Language. The vision was clear: make the language read like English sentences, and business analysts would write their own programs. No need for specialized programmers. This vision had genuine appeal. Software was becoming essential to business operations, yet programmers remained a scarce, expensive resource. COBOL promised to democratize software creation. What happened instead? COBOL became another programming language requiring specialized training. Business analysts who tried to write COBOL quickly discovered that readable syntax didn’t eliminate the complexity of logic, data structures, or system design.

He also affirmed Canada's support for Greenland, Denmark and the Nato alliance, drawing applause. Carney did not mention Donald Trump by name, but some of his remarks seemed aimed at the US president, who is threatening to tariff European allies and the UK unless Greenland is surrendered to the US. \"Great powers\" are often defined as countries with permanent seats on United Nations Security Council - China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States - which shows their economic and military dominance in the world. Middle powers, such as Canada, Australia, Argentina, South Korea and Brazil, are nations that still exert large influence in global politics, even though their economies are smaller. In his speech, Carney said the world is \"in the midst of a rupture, not a transition\". \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,\" he said. He also said \"Canada was amongst the first to hear the wake-up call\" that geography and historic alliances no longer guaranteed security or prosperity. When Trump returned to office, he frequently referred to Canada as the \"51st state\" and threatened to join Canada and the US through \"economic force.\" The US then hit its northern neighbour and major trading partner with steep tariffs.

Tauformer’s goal is to inject domain structure directly into attention by using a Graph Laplacian built from a domain embedding space (a “domain memory”) as a persistent reference.\nInstead of ranking keys by \\(Q\\cdot K\\), Tauformer ranks them by how similar their Laplacian-derived taumode scalars are, which is intended to bias attention toward domain-relevant relations rather than generic geometric similarity. At the implementation level, Tauformer keeps the familiar Q/K/V projections, RoPE, causal masking, and stable softmax/value aggregation pipeline, but changes how attention logits are computed.\nEach head vector is compressed into a scalar \\(\\lambda\\) using a bounded Rayleigh-quotient energy computed with a feature-space Laplacian \\(L\\), then logits are computed as a negative distance \\(-|\\lambda_q-\\lambda_k|/\\text{temperature}\\). Key building blocks (as implemented): Because scoring no longer needs full key vectors, Tauformer’s KV-cache can store values plus a compact key-side scalar stream rather than both K and V tensors.\nConcretely, the cache payload is \\((V,\\lambda_k)\\) (not \\((K,V)\\)), which yields an approximate ~50% per-layer cache reduction for typical head dimensions (small overhead for storing the extra scalar). The design also anticipates using a sparse Laplacian from a precomputed domain manifold so computing \\(\\lambda\\) can depend on Laplacian sparsity (nnz) rather than dense \\(D^2\\) multiplication. It exchanges the long preliminary adjustment of weights with a pre-training shorter phase in which a Laplacian is built using arrowspace . This run trains a 30M-class TauGPT.\nTraining uses AdamW with base LR \\(5\\times10^{-4}\\) and a warmup of 100 steps, then kee", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

Nathan Yaffe ( @n-th-n ) is an immigration attorney and organizer based in New York. The unprecedented military-style occupation of U.S. cities under the banner of “immigration enforcement” has made obvious what organizers have long known: ICE and CBP regularly skirt the law. They abuse and coerce people into giving up rights, target dissent , weaponize existing legal powers to erode due process , and insulate rights violations from review through jurisdiction-stripping provisions or post-hoc approval of illegal practices . We might describe these tactics as lawlessness in the shadow of law—that is, while the conduct violates the letter and spirit of the law, the agencies either seek legal approval or endeavor to keep the legality of their conduct from being reviewed at all, knowing that review will force them to change course. In recent months, however, there has been a significant evolution in the immigration agencies’ lawlessness: they are increasingly stepping into direct confrontation with the institutions exercising legal oversight. Certain conflicts have gained significant attention, such as illegally refusing Congressional representatives access to ICE facilities and repeatedly lying and obstructing in court . Yet likely the most widespread such confrontation is happening over the practice of mandatory detention, a statutory authority for ICE to incarcerate someone without bond until the end of immigration proceedings. As I explain in this post, DHS and EOIR (which houses immigration courts) have purported to re-interpret longstanding laws to subject the vast majority of people in removal proceedings to mandatory detention.

One of our engineers demos an early TUI for Claude approvals and what becomes the foundation of research / plan / implement. There are about 3 hours of presentations. Geoff shows up 2 hours late and presents last. He completely steals the show, diving deep on ralph, cursed lang (at the time, the compiler stack is written in Rust), livestreaming autonomous coding overnight while asleep in Australia, subagents in amp code, the virtues of drinking 3 margaritas and shouting at cursor, and much, much more. Geoff talks about the \"overbaking\" phenomenon. If you leave ralph running too long, you end up with all sorts of bizarre emergent behavior, like post-quantum cryptography support. It has dimensions of art, deep engineering, the embrace of chaos, and the raw and authentic joy of making a thing. All ~15 of us have a long and (imo) somewhat unsettling conversation about the future of software dev—about how easy it is to take a SaaS and copy 80-90% of it, and about how many types of work are about to change or disappear entirely.

This April, one national poll found that two-thirds of Americans were concerned about a constitutional crisis. Yet the nation’s founding document still rates as high as ever, with about nine out of ten people expressing a favorable view. Should they, though? Is the Constitution really up to the task of preserving democracy in this moment? Or is it, as the title of a Wednesday evening discussion asked, “broken”?

It's not writing code, system designs, or having estoric knowledge of a programming language (i.e., Rust). AI coding agents have gotten very, very good . A year ago, I'd reach out to Cursor hesitantly for MVPs or quick fixes. Today, I use Claude Code for almost all non-trivial programming tasks and have spent $500+ on it just last December. AI talks online revolve much around the hard skils. Initially it was prompt tricks to accomplish X, then the best MCPs for Y, and so on. But with Opus 4.5, using vanilla Claude Code gets you 80% there. Even in the age of AI, the 80/20 rule still applies. So, what should engineers focus on? One thing with coding agents is that the better the spec, the more in line they will be with the technical and business requirements. But getting a good spec is hard. In real life, tickets rarely contain all the requirements. To do so, you might need to: Doing these things well used to be optional for individual contributors. Certain teams would enable engineers to thrive being an average communicator but excellent coder. Now, the non-coding parts are becoming a non-negotiable. Software engineers are problem solvers.

According to local officials, the Rodalies train collided with a retaining wall which fell on to the track between Gelida and Sant Sadurní. Catalonia regional fire Inspector Claudi Gallardo said all the passengers had been removed from the train. The incident occurred as heavy storms battered north-eastern Spain, with coastal areas in the east and north-west of Spain on high alert because of the weather. Rail officials believe the wall collapsed as the train was passing shortly after 21:00 (20:00 GMT) on Tuesday evening, striking the driver's cab first and then causing considerable damage to the first carriage of the train in which most of the injured passengers were travelling. The identity of the driver was not immediately clear as three trainees had been with the driver when the accident happened. Firefighters said two of them were among those seriously injured. It took almost an hour to free one of the survivors at the scene in Gelida, about 35km (22 miles) west of Barcelona.

Without invoking U.S. President Donald Trump by name, Carney referenced \"American hegemony\" and said \"great powers\" are using economic integration as \"weapons.\" \"Canadians know that our old, comfortable assumption that our geography and alliance memberships automatically conferred prosperity and security is no longer valid,\" Carney said. As it grapples with this new dynamic, Carney said Canada must be \"principled and pragmatic\" and turn inward to build up the country and diversify trading relationships to become less reliant on countries like the U.S., now that it's clear \"integration\" can lead to \"subordination.\" Carney said multilateralism and the \"architecture of collective problem-solving\" — relying on institutions like the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and Conference of the Parties (COP) for climate talks — has been \"diminished\" and countries have to accept they may have to go it alone more often than in the recent past. \"Many countries are drawing the same conclusions.

Our mission to design a web framework specifically for building websites — what we call content-driven websites, to better distinguish from data-driven, stateful web applications — resonated. Now Astro is downloaded almost 1,000,000 times per week, and has been used by 100,000s of developers to build fast, beautiful websites.

The first was straightforward: why had everyone been surprised by the dissolution of the Soviet Union? The USSR had been the second pole of a bipolar world order, and theories of world politics should probably be able to account for the advent, and the exit, of the superpowers that shape the world those theories purport to explain. The second was more vexing—and more interesting, because it looked forward: why had the bipolar world been succeeded by a unipolar world? Why hadn’t Japan, Germany, or other countries seized the moment to balance against the United States and become superpowers themselves? After all, if countries are motivated by the prospect of maximizing their relative power and security, surely it’s better to be the leader of your own camp rather than a follower in another’s. How long could unipolarity last? And would what came afterward be as sanguinary as the multipolar world that had collapsed into the First World War? And yet the world remained stubbornly unipolar for decades. The United States worried about rising powers and rogue states, but the major powers in the system—Russia eventually a notable exception—were largely content to let Washington take the lead. For some, this vindicated theories in which institutional legacies were most important; for others, it pointed to the importance of the full-spectrum power—soft, hard, smart, and dumb—that the United States could maintain. A quieter camp pointed out that the United States was generally doing a lot—not all it could, but a lot—to make its leadership attractive to the other major powers: providing security, yes, but also shouldering a good share of global burdens in many fields while also linking its economy and society to the rest of the world.

Projects that are able to\nsetup structure around the agent itself, to provide it with automated feedback on quality and correctness, have been able\nto push them to work on longer horizon tasks. This back pressure helps the agent identify mistakes as it progresses and models are now good enough that this feedback\ncan keep them aligned to a task for much longer. As an engineer, this means you can increase your leverage by delegating\nprogressively more complex tasks to agents, while increasing trust that when completed they are at a satisfactory standard. Imagine for a second if you only gave an agent tools that allow it to edit files. Without a way to interact with a build\nsystem the model relies on you for feedback about whether or not the change it made is sensible. This means you spend your back pressure (the time you spend giving feedback to agents) on typing a message telling the agent it missed an import. This\nscales poorly and limits you to working on simple problems. If you’re directly responsible for checking each line of code produced is syntactically valid, then that’s time taken away\nfrom thinking about the larger goals or problems in your software.

Learn more. January 18, 2026  Google has responded to our recent report on new Google Play strings hinting at changes to how Android will handle sideloaded apps in the future. The company has now confirmed that a “high-friction” install process is on the way. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority ? Replying to our story on X, Matthew Forsyth, Director of Product Management, Google Play Developer Experience & Chief Product Explainer, said the system isn’t a sideloading restriction, but an “Accountability Layer.” Advanced users will still be able to choose “Install without verifying,” though Google says that path will involve extra steps meant to ensure users understand the risks of installing apps from unverified developers. That explanation broadly matches what we’re seeing in recent versions of Google Play, where new warning messages emphasize developer verification, internet requirements, and potential risks, while still allowing users to proceed. What remains to be seen is how far Google takes this “high-friction” approach. Clear warnings are one thing, but quietly making sideloading more painful is another. Android’s openness has always depended on power users being able to install apps without excessive hoops. For now, Google hasn’t suggested requirements like using a PC or external tools, and we hope the added friction is limited to risk education. Thank you for being part of our community.

Written by: Nic Losby Mandiant is publicly releasing a comprehensive dataset of Net-NTLMv1 rainbow tables to underscore the urgency of migrating away from this outdated protocol. Despite Net-NTLMv1 being deprecated and known to be insecure for over two decades—with cryptanalysis dating back to 1999—Mandiant consultants continue to identify its use in active environments. This legacy protocol leaves organizations vulnerable to trivial credential theft, yet it remains prevalent due to inertia and a lack of demonstrated immediate risk. By releasing these tables, Mandiant aims to lower the barrier for security professionals to demonstrate the insecurity of Net-NTLMv1. While tools to exploit this protocol have existed for years, they often required uploading sensitive data to third-party services or expensive hardware to brute-force keys. The release of this dataset allows defenders and researchers to recover keys in under 12 hours using consumer hardware costing less than $600 USD. This initiative highlights the amplified impact of combining Mandiant's frontline expertise with Google Cloud's resources to eliminate entire classes of attacks. This post details the generation of the tables, provides access to the dataset for community use, and outlines critical remediation steps to disable Net-NTLMv1 and prevent authentication coercion attacks. Net-NTLMv1 has been widely known to be insecure since at least 2012, following presentations at DEFCON 20, with cryptanalysis of the underlying protocol dating back to at least 1999 .

The very first version was intentionally simple. It ran on Postgres , because speed of shipping mattered more than theoretical scaling. That got us to a real product and a real community fast. Then people actually started to use the product more than we could have imagined.

It was on the smaller side; there were probably a few hundred attendees and the audiences ranged from about twenty to hundreds of attendees for the keynotes. After one of the talks, a speaker came up and said “you were such a good audience member, thank you!”. I said the same thing to one of the attendees of the talk I gave. I wanted to share how you can be a good audience member at a conference talk. It’s important to note that this advice is for attending in-person talks where the speaker can see the audience. This is typically when there are up to one hundred people. I’ve spoken in front of 800 people and it’s a different experience. While some of these principles apply, in general individual behavior is less important as audience size grows. And online talks are an entirely different experience for everyone, both audience and speaker! I don’t have enough experience to give any advice for that scenario. First, though, why would you care to be a good member of an in-person audience? After all, you are providing your time and money to the conference and the presenter. Isn’t it the speaker’s job to entertain and educate you ? Why would you expend any energy to help them do so? First, I’m a big fan of being respectful of other human beings and helping them succeed. Public speaking is a common fear and being a good audience member can reassure the speaker and reduce that fear. It’s hard up there, whether it’s your first talk or your hundredth. The second reason is that you can make a talk better for yourself . You can learn more and you can tune their presentation to your needs. They are an expert and you can take advantage of their expertise. So, here are my tips on how to be a great audience member: Am I always a good audience member? Nope. I get distracted sometimes.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving it against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ordered hierarchy of content objects or OHCO ) was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult. [ 4 ] In 2008, Jeni Tennison identified markup overlap as \"the main remaining problem area for markup technologists\". [ 5 ] Markup overlap continues to be a primary issue in the digital study of theological texts in 2019, and is a major reason for the field retaining specialised markup formats—the Open Scripture Information Standard and the Theological Markup Language —rather than the inter-operable Text Encoding Initiative -based formats common to the rest of the digital humanities . [ 6 ] A distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.\nContiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical ones. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind ( self-overlap ).

It then proceeds to move either clockwise or counterclockwise to the adjacent hour marker, one at a time, and repeats until all hour markers have been visited at least once. What is the probability that it ends on the 6? These sort of puzzles always intrigue me. They're simple to describe and at first might even look easy to solve, but as I dig into them, my intuition leads me astray. What a fun Saturday morning project! I whipped up a simulator to try it out. It works like this: See, it is simple. But before running the simulator, can you guess the probability of it ending on 6? What about 11 or 1? 3? The other numbers? It stumped me. My guess was that 6 would be the most likely—it is the farthest away but it is also necessary to visit all other numbers first. The numbers closer to 12 would be gradually less likely. Am I right? It might remind you of other random walk problems. So what is the answer? Well, I first ran the simulator 100 times and the results looked random. More runs! After ~1500 runs, all of the numbers were showing 8-10% likelihood with no discernable pattern. That isn't what I expected. After 5000 runs, they were all 8.4-9.7%. And then after 10,000 runs... Based on the simulator, all numbers are equally likely with 9% probability , excluding 12 of course, since that is visited first and thus can't be last. The answer is 1 ⁄ 11 .

How do we wrangle behavior that is intrinsically non-deterministic so that it can be used in structured, deterministic systems? The flexibility of input is great! But the variation of output makes it difficult to do further processing by conventional software. In this simple example I’ll characterize and constrain a non-deterministic result to make it usable in deterministic software. This leads into domain modeling and strategic design. What follows isn’t rocket science, but it is the sort of basics I think we need to apply in order to get results. Let’s start with a use-case I actually have. When I’m trying to get my bearings in a software system, I usually want to know what domains are addressed and in which parts of the code. So imagine an app that would generate that sort of view of a repo: To be concrete, let’s look at the open source project “OpenEMR”. Here’s a very small code sample from that project: We might ask, “what domains are addressed in this code?” Conventional code does not lend itself to that kind of question, but it is a natural use of an LLM. An intelligent answer! But we couldn’t pass that to conventional software for further processing. Of course, we would instruct the LLM to structure and format its output. Okay, so now we have an answer that could be integrated in a technical way. Yet this is will not support the comparisons and hierarchical roll-ups I was hoping for. Because categories are chosen freely in each run, the classification of different files will not be easy to compare. To illustrate the point, I’ll repeat the same question using the same file. Every time I ask question I get a different answer: The answers make sense individually but would be difficult to compare or combine.

To explore how they can enrich rather than reduce, I set Claude Code up with tools to mine a library of 100 non-fiction books.\nIt found sequences of excerpts connected by an interesting idea, or trails . Browse all trails Here’s a part of one such trail, linking deception in the startup world to the social psychology of mass movements (I’m especially pleased by the jump from Jobs to Theranos): Steve Jobs Bad Blood Zero to One The True Believer The books were selected from Hacker News’ favourites, which I previously scraped and visualized . Claude browses the books a chunk at a time. A chunk is a segment of roughly 500 words that aligns with paragraphs when possible.\nThis length is a good balance between saving tokens and providing enough context for ideas to breathe. Chunks are indexed by topic, and topics are themselves indexed for search. This makes it easy to look up all passages in the corpus that relate to, say, deception . This works well when you know what to look for, but search alone can’t tell you which topics are present to begin with.\nThere are over 100,000 extracted topics, far too many to be browsed directly. To support exploration, they are grouped into a hierarchical tree structure. This yields around 1,000 top-level topics. They emerge from combining lower-level topics, and not all of them are equally useful: However, this Borgesian taxonomy is good enough for Claude to piece together what the books are about. Claude uses the topic tree and the search via a few CLI tools. They allow it to: To generate the trails, the agent works in stages. Even though I’ve been using Claude Code to develop for months, my first instinct for this project was to consider it as a traditional pipeline of several discrete stages.\nMy initial attempt at this system consisted of multiple LLM modules with carefully hand-assembled contexts.

One of these was the Potensic Atom 2. It’s a photo and video drone with a gimbal-stabilized 4K camera and a remote control that you hook up to your own smartphone and the proprietary app. If you’ve ever flown a DJI Mini 4K, this drone will look very familiar to you.  Potensic Atom 2  This post is part of a two-part series that will cover how we disassembled the drone and dumped the firmware from the NAND chip and how we analyzed the drone’s firmware, app, and remote control to find some backdoors and vulnerabilities. One of the most important pieces of information you can acquire when setting up to hack a device is its firmware. If you want to reverse engineer the software that’s running on the drone and find vulnerabilities in that, then you need a copy of it in the first place. Now there are a couple of ways to go about that, some are less intrusive and some are more effective. You might get lucky and be able to just download the firmware as a firmware update from the manufacturer’s website. However, those update sites are often not publicly documented and can be locked behind authorization checks or encrypted. Encrypted firmwares can still be useful - you “just” need to reverse engineer the on-device decryption process. For the Atom 2, downloading the firmware updates required having a valid drone and remote control serial number and the firmware update was also encrypted. Without having the decryption logic, we put this approach on ice during our initial research. Another really comfortable approach is to use exposed debug interfaces like JTAG or UART. However, those are often undocumented, unlabeled, or entirely removed for public versions. We didn’t find any on the Atom 2. What we can always do, though not necessarily always successful, is solder off the entire NAND chip an", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

First, we split customer interaction data into training and validation sets. Then, we train our recommenders on the training set before evaluating them on the validation set, usually on metrics such as recall, precision, and NDCG. This is similar to how we evaluate supervised machine learning models and doesn’t seem unusual at first glance. But don’t our recommendations change how customers click or purchase? If customers can only interact with items shown to them, why do we perform offline evaluation on static historical data? It took me a while to put a finger on it but I think this is why it felt weird: We’re treating recommendations as an observational problem when it really is an interventional problem . Problems solved via supervised machine learning are usually observational problems. Given an observation such as product title, description, and image, we try to predict the product category. Our model learns P(category=phone|title=“…”, description=“…”, image=image01.jpeg) . On the other hand, recommendations are an interventional problem. We want to learn how different interventions (i.e., item recommendations) lead to different outcomes (i.e., clicks, purchases). By using logged customer interaction data as labels, the observational offline evaluation approach ignores the interventional nature of recommendations. As a result, we’re not evaluating if users would click or purchase more due to our new recommendations; we’re evaluating how well the new recommendations fit logged data. Thus, what our model learns is P(view3=iphone|view1=pixel, view2=galaxy) when what we really want is P(click=True|recommend=iphone, view1=pixel, view2=galaxy) . The straightforward way to evaluate recommendations as an interventional problem is via A/B testing.

Since then, we've invested heavily in making Claude the most capable model for scientific work , with Opus 4.5 showing significant improvements in figure interpretation, computational biology, and protein understanding benchmarks. These advances, informed by our partnerships with researchers in academia and industry, reflect our commitment to understanding exactly how scientists are using AI to accelerate progress.  We’ve also been working closely with scientists through our AI for Science program, which provides free API credits to leading researchers working on high-impact scientific projects around the world.  These researchers have developed custom systems that use Claude in ways that go far beyond tasks like literature reviews or coding assistance. In the labs we spoke to, Claude is a collaborator that works across all stages of the research process: making it easier and more cost-effective to understand which experiments to run, using a variety of tools to help compress projects that normally take months into hours, and finding patterns in massive datasets that humans might overlook. In many cases it’s eliminating bottlenecks, handling tasks that require deep knowledge and have previously been impossible to scale; in some it’s enabling entirely different research approaches than researchers have traditionally been able to take. In other words, Claude is beginning to reshape how these scientists work—and point them towards novel scientific insights and discoveries.  One bottleneck in biological research is the fragmentation of tools: there are hundreds of databases, software packages, and protocols available, and researchers spend substantial time selecting from and mastering various platforms.

The MD-11F freighter operated by UPS, crashed after one of its engines separated from the wing as it was preparing to take off from Louisville. The plane briefly lifted off from the runway, before hurtling out of control into an industrial area. Fifteen people died as a result, including three crew and 12 on the ground. In an update report , the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that cracks found in the engine mounting assembly had previously occurred on several other aircraft. At the time the manufacturer responsible for the aircraft, Boeing, concluded that the issue \"would not result in a safety of flight condition\". The MD-11 is a relatively elderly design that was originally produced by McDonnell Douglas.  Boeing acquired the company in 1997. The last MD-11 came off the production line in 2001, but Boeing has continued providing parts and service support. In the aftermath of the Kentucky disaster, the NTSB issued a preliminary report which drew attention to cracks in the engine attachment mechanism. Its latest update goes further, describing fractures due to evidence of \"fatigue\" – or repeated stresses - in a critical bearing, as well as the mounting it is meant to sit in. It points out that Boeing had previously found failures of the same part on four occasions, affecting three different aircraft. In 2011, the company sent a \"service letter\" to operators warning them of its findings. This is a non legally-binding document used to alert operators about important safety or maintenance information. In this case, Boeing recommended that the part be included in a general visual inspection every five years. It also pointed out changes to the inspection procedure contained in the aircraft maintenance manual, and drew attention to a revised bearing assembly that could be fi", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

It also remains as my favorite language to prototype stuff in, though I’m not quite sure why. In any case, C is an interesting language without much standardization on the whole “style” or “practices” part. Most other languages have very clear “this is the best way to use X” messages, either subtly embedded in the syntax itself or through “official” documentation channels. C doesn’t have an official documentation channel, nor does it have syntax or standard library constructs that encourage one particular way of doing things. From this, there’s a bunch of inconsistencies in how people do things, and–especially in the early days of the language and standard library–the landscape and general practice is quite error prone. As such, I’ve developed my own habits when writing C, usually picked up from blog posts, writing C# or rust, or just out of perfectionist brain. I’m not saying you should write stuff this way, nor am I claiming it is the best way to write C all the time. I break some of these practices when working with embedded systems or when I’m writing things to be as fast as they can possibly be.

In retrospect, I think the entire DevOps movement was a mighty, twenty year battle to achieve one thing: a single feedback loop connecting devs with prod. On those grounds, it failed. Not because software engineers weren’t good at their jobs, or didn’t care enough. It failed because the technology wasn’t good enough. The tools we gave them weren’t designed for this, so using them could easily double, triple, or quadruple the time it took to do their job: writing business logic. This isn’t true everywhere.

Researchers say the convergent evolution among mammals toward this dietary strategy—called myrmecophagy—emerged following the K-Pg extinction and fall of non-avian dinosaurs, which reshaped ecosystems and set the stage for ant and termite colonies to rapidly expand worldwide, driving extreme shifts in feeding modes for certain species. \"There's not been an investigation into how this dramatic diet evolved across all known mammal species until now,\" said Phillip Barden, the study's corresponding author and associate professor of biology at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). \"This work gives us the first real roadmap, and what really stands out is just how powerful a selective force ants and termites have been over the last 50 million years—shaping environments and literally changing the face of entire species.\" Over 200 mammal species are known to eat ants and termites today, yet only about 20 true myrmecophages—such as giant anteaters, aardvarks and pangolins—have evolved traits like long sticky tongues, specialized claws and stomachs, and reduced o", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

But by suspending approval, it does send a strong message of discontent to the White House that EU lawmakers argued would unnerve American businesses. \"It is an extremely powerful lever – I don't think companies would agree to give up the European market,\" Valerie Hayer, president of the centrist Renew group, told journalists. Trump has threatened to hit six EU countries – including powerhouses France and Germany – with tariffs for not going along with his demand to get Greenland. EU leaders are set to hold an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday evening over the US threats against Denmark's autonomous territory, Greenland. The bloc is weighing different responses if Trump does not back down, including putting last year's trade deal on hold and hitting the US with €93 billion in tariffs. The package of retaliatory tariffs was agreed at the height of the EU-US trade standoff last year, but was ultimately suspended until February 6 to avoid an all-out trade war. Beyond that, French President Emmanuel Macron is pushing to unleash the bloc's potent anti-coercion trade instrument to use in case Trump makes good on his threats.

How has the language of greetings evolved around the world - and what does it tell us about ourselves? We use \"hello\" dozens of times a day without thinking – during phone calls, emails and face-to-face encounters. We sing it along with Adele and Lionel Richie, and we have watched it spun into moments of screen gold in Jerry Maguire (\"You had me at hello\"), and Scarface (\"Say hello to my little friend!\"). It's been used to sell everything from mobile phones (Motorola's \"Hello, Moto\") to lingerie (Wonderbra's iconic \"Hello boys\"), and it has been borrowed to name computer programs and celebrity magazines. In print, this ubiquitous, friendly greeting has a surprisingly short history. Two centuries ago, on 18 January 1826, \"hello\" made what is thought to be its earliest recorded appearance on the page, in a Connecticut newspaper called The Norwich Courier. Hidden among the column inches, it was a modest in-ink debut for a word that would go on to greet much of the modern world. By the 1850s, it had crossed the Atlantic to Britain – appearing in publications such as the London Literary Gazette – and became increasingly common in print. Like the go-to greetings in other languages, \"hello\" also says something about the English-speaking world – depending on which variation, abbreviation or inflection of the word we choose to use. There are plenty of such forms. Whether due to dialect or accent influences, or the brevity demanded by online communication, which \"hello\" you choose says a lot about you, and can indicate age, nationality, or even mood. According to linguists, elongated variations such as \"heyyy\" could be construed as flirtatious, \"hellaw\" might suggest you're from the southern US, \"howdy\" from western US, and the clipped \"hi\" may indicate a curt disposition. \"It can be pronounced and inflected in many different ways, and these subtle intonat", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

These code models can be used at runtime to modify the code, perform optimizations, and/or perform code transformations to other programming models. Furthermore, code reflection allows Java developers to interact with foreign programming models and foreign programming languages without using any 3rd party libraries. One of the foreign programming environments we are exploring in the project Babylon is the GPU environment through the CUDA and OpenCL programming models, called HAT ( Heterogeneous Accelerator Toolkit). The goal for HAT is to be able to offload and run efficient parallel workloads on hardware accelerators. Through this article, we want to tackle these two questions: Each of these questions presents its own set of challenges. The majority of the projects focus on the first challenge with projects such as Sumatra , Aparapi , Marawacc , RootBeer , JaBEE , IBM J9 , and more recently TornadoVM . These projects have focused on abstracting GPU programmability and make it easier for Java developers. While they achieve reasonable high performance ( e.g., TornadoVMâs study ) by leveraging specialized accelerators, they often do so at the cost of hindering access to advanced GPU optimizations. However, in the era of AI and high-demand computing, simply being faster than Java on CPUs might not be enough. The second question goes a step further and rethink about how Java programmers could approach native performance on hardware accelerators while still maintaining reasonable high-level constructs. This is a very thin line between what to expose from low-level APIs and from what level of the native software stack.

Wiz Research uncovered CodeBreach , a critical vulnerability that placed the AWS Console supply chain at risk. The issue allowed a complete takeover of key AWS GitHub repositories - most notably the AWS JavaScript SDK, a core library that powers the AWS Console . By exploiting CodeBreach, attackers could have injected malicious code to launch a platform-wide compromise, potentially affecting not just the countless applications depending on the SDK, but the Console itself, threatening every AWS account . The vulnerability stemmed from a subtle flaw in how the repositories’ AWS CodeBuild CI pipelines handled build triggers. Just two missing characters in a Regex filter allowed unauthenticated attackers to infiltrate the build environment and leak privileged credentials. This post breaks down how we leveraged this subtle misconfiguration to achieve a full repository takeover, and provides key recommendations for CodeBuild users to harden their own projects against similar attacks. Wiz responsibly disclosed all findings to AWS, who promptly remediated the issue. AWS also implemented global hardening measures within the CodeBuild service to prevent similar attacks. Most notably, the new Pull Request Comment Approval build gate offers organizations a simple and secure path to prevent untrusted builds. Read the AWS Advisory here . This issue follows a familiar pattern seen in recent supply-chain attacks like the Nx S1ngularity incident, where subtle CI/CD misconfigurations lead to disproportionately impactful attacks.

During an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast alongside his co-star, Damon spoke about collaborating with Netflix, saying they want bigger action earlier in such films, and push for the plot to be repeated to accommodate attention spans. “The standard way to make an action movie that we learned was, you usually have three set pieces,” he said. “One in the first act, one in the second, one in the third… You spend most of your money on that one in the third act. That’s your finale.  “And now they’re like, ‘Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay tuned in.

{"title": "Semiconductor Fabs III: Ion Implantation", "url": "https://nomagicpill.substack.com/p/ion-implantation", "content": "Ion implantation is a common process used in the semiconductor industry to change the properties of a material, namely silicon (the substrate). Physics, equipment used, process considerations, alternatives, and further resources are discussed. While I wrote this in 2020 and some advances have been made, the principles remain the same. First, why are ions shot into silicon (Si)? What does it do from a physics perspective? The reason has to do with the band gap , the energy difference between the valence band and conduction band. Within Si exist both electrons (negatively-charged) and electron holes (positively-charged). The hole is a bit of an oddity: it’s an unoccupied space where an electron could exist, but doesn’t at that moment. While not literally a particle, they can be treated and thought of as such. Current can be viewed as the flow of electrons or holes. When a bias is applied, electrons begin to move and occupy holes. When electron A moves to hole B, hole A is formed. This propagates and creates the flow of charge, or current. What does this have to do with Si? Si has four valence electrons in its four states of 3s 2 3p 2 . Those four valence electrons covalently bond with the surrounding Si crystal lattice structure, effectively filling that Si atom’s valence shell. So, when an ion is introduced into the lattice that does not have four valence electrons, one of two things happen: there are free electrons (if the number of valence electrons is >4, such as in phosphorus’s case) or free holes (valence electrons <4, such as boron). In the first case, four of phosphorus’s (P’s) electrons have bonded to surrounding Si atoms’ valence electrons, leaving the fifth one free and able to contribute to current, making it a donor impurity, because it donates an electron. This creates an n(egative)-type semiconductor. In the second case, three of boron’s (B’s) electrons have bonded to surrounding Si atoms, but one Si atom and the B atom both have incomplete valence shel", "source": "HackerNews", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}

But even if Trump were to somehow make Greenland a U.S. territory (something Denmark vehemently opposes), experts say the island’s harsh climate and environment make mining Greenland’s natural resources an unachievable goal. Greenland has significant supplies of rare earth elements. These 17 metals, with “exotic-sounding names like terbium and neodymium, are vital for many everyday technologies,” said the BBC . Household items like televisions and smartphones would “not work without them.” Trump wants to tap into Greenland’s supply of rare earth minerals as part of an effort to overtake China, the country that currently “controls the world’s supply,” said Tony Sage, the CEO of Critical Metals, to the BBC. But rare earth minerals are not Greenland’s only natural resource . Many “occurrences of graphite and graphite schist are reported from many localities on the island,” said Reuters . Other minerals commonly found in the territory include diamonds, gold, nickel, titanium, tungsten, zinc and more, according to Greenland’s Mineral Resources Authority. Escape your echo chamber.

I'd been working on a little project with Pedrique (who would become my co-founder) for a bit over half-a-year and decided I had enough signal to determine he was someone I wanted to start a business with. I was excited about the idea we were working on at the time (we were live with paying customers and truly believed in the thesis), but in hindsight, being truly honest about my motivations, I mostly wanted to run my own thing. In a dream world I'd have had the \"idea of my life\" while working at PostHog or Doublepoint and have gone on to build that with maximum conviction but this wasn't the case, so I got tired of waiting for a spark and decided to go out and make it happen, with the idea we were working on being our best bet at the time. Since I'd just quit my job, I had my finances well in order. Thus, my ideal scenario would have been to keep working on the product we had, try to scale it, and if that didn't work, try something else, then something else, until something did indeed really get off the ground, and only at that point we would consider whether or not to raise VC funding, depending on whether it made sense or not. My ideal scenario wasn't going to work for Pedrique, though. He had told me for a while that the money he had saved up for trying to build his own thing was running out and that soon he'd need to start freelancing or something to make some income in order to sustain the search for a little longer. Prior to us working together, he had a bit of success with his MicroSaaS products but only just enough to increase his personal runway, which was now reasonably short. We had spoken about this before, but with me now being 110% in, we had to do something about it.

Memdeklaro positions itself as a humanitarian alternative to the exclusionary state monopoly on identity and supports the three freedoms: freedom of name, freedom of belief and freedom of association. Memdeklaro supports a world where people are judged only on their character, beliefs and actions, not on where they were born, who they were born to, or what their birth culture was. A world where individuals have power over their own lives - the power to leave corrupt governments, hostile cultures and abusers, and thrive in a self-chosen community. \"Self-declaration of identity gives people the power to decide their own fate, and creates a world where actions and beliefs matter more than arbitrary circumstances of birth.\" Millions of people worldwide have no access to government ID. Nation-states routinely refuse to issue birth certificates, national ID cards and passports to people, most often due to the circumstances of their birth, rather than due to their own actions as an adult. This group may include stateless people, refugees, people who weren’t registered at birth, and people who escaped from child abuse, domestic abuse or cult abuse. As government ID is increasingly required for employment, housing, healthcare, education, travel and daily life necessities, this leaves people at best on the edge of society or at worst criminalized for existing.

(In French): It's a pleasure — and a duty — to be with you at this turning point for Canada and for the world. Today, I'll talk about the rupture in the world order, the end of a nice story and the beginning of a brutal reality where geopolitics among the great powers is not subject to any constraints. But I also submit to you that other countries, particularly middle powers like Canada, are not powerless. They have the capacity to build a new order that embodies our values, like respect for human rights, sustainable development, solidarity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. The power of the less powerful begins with honesty. It seems that every day we're reminded that we live in an era of great power rivalry. That the rules-based order is fading. That the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must. This aphorism of Thucydides is presented as inevitable — as the natural logic of international relations reasserting itself. And faced with this logic, there is a strong tendency for countries to go along to get along. To accommodate. To avoid trouble. To hope that compliance will buy safety. It won't. So, what are our options?

Every morning, this shopkeeper places a sign in his window: \"Workers of the world, unite!\" He doesn't believe it. No one does.

Here’s a sneak peek at the result: In this post, I’d like to share my research and process for getting this all to work. Patched the News Channel’s hardcoded Nintendo URL to point to an S3 storage bucket using Go and wadlib to extract the necessary binary file and edit it in-memory Modified WiiLink’s open-source news file generator to add “El Nuevo Día” as a news source Set up AWS Lambda + EventBridge to regenerate the necessary news binary files hourly Source code: WiiNewsPR and WiiNewsPR-Patcher The News Channel debuted in North America on January 26, 2007, a little over two months after the Wii’s launch. Since that date, it mostly came pre-installed with Wii consoles and was a novel way to read news from all over the world. Together with other “utility” channels like the Forecast Channel, it tried to position the Wii as more than just a gaming console. Check out a video recording of the service from right before it was discontinued on June 27th, 2013: Before we can consider displaying custom news on it, we have to figure out how the News Channel actually fetches content. We know that it must have fetched news somehow since it displays a “Downloading…” splash screen on startup. Luckily for us, the Wii natively supports proxying via its internet connection configuration settings! Meaning we can set up something like mitmproxy on a local machine and observe its HTTP behavior.

I had never heard the term “ sundowning ” before it happened to my own father, yet it’s a fairly common syndrome. In his last few months my father remained lucid and rational — remained himself — during daylight hours. Once the sun went down he deteriorated, becoming confused, paranoid and aggressive. It’s terrible to watch sundowning in someone you love. But that’s a personal tragedy – not a national or global one. It’s an entirely different matter when the president of the United States is sundowning — a president surrounded by malign sycophants who tell him whatever he wants to hear and indulge his every whim, no matter how destructive. For good reasons, it’s normally bad practice to pronounce on someone’s mental health from afar. Some of us still remember when right-wing pundits liked to call anyone critical of George W. Bush mentally ill . But after reading the letter that Trump just sent to the prime minister of Norway (Jonas Gahr Støre has confirmed that it’s genuine) there should be no doubt that we have a president who is suffering a real detachment from reality: Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.

It updates specific MLP layers to \"learn\" the current context.\n * **Outer Loop:** The model's initial weights are meta-learned during training to be \"highly updateable\" or optimized for this test-time adaptation\n\n**From the Paper:** \"Overall, our empirical observations strongly indicate that TTT-E2E should produce the same trend as full attention for scaling with training compute in large-budget production runs.\"\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n####Abstract:\n\n&gt;We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture a Transformer with sliding-window attention. \n&gt;\n&gt;**However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights.** In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. \n&gt;\n&gt;In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7x faster than full attention for 128K context. **Our code is publicly available.**\n\n\n---\n\n####Layman's Explanation:\n\nThink of this paper as solving the memory bottleneck by fundamentally changing how a model processes information. Imagine you are taking a massive open-book exam. \n\nA standard Transformer (like GPT-4) is the student who frantically re-reads every single page of the textbook before answering every single question. This strategy guarantees they find the specific details (perfect recall), but as the textbook gets thicker, they get exponentially slower until they simply cannot finish the test in time. \n\nOn the other hand, alternatives like RNNs or Mamba try to summarize the entire textbook onto a single index card. They can answer questions instantly because they don't have to look back at the book, but for long, complex subjects, they eventually run out of space on the card and start forgetting crucial information.\n\nThis new method, Test-Time Training (TTT), changes the paradigm from retrieving information to learning it on the fly. Instead of re-reading the book or summarizing it onto a card, the TTT model treats the context window as a dataset and actually trains itself on it in real-time. It performs a mini-gradient descent update on its own neural weights as it reads. **This is equivalent to a student who reads the textbook and physically rewires their brain to master the subject matter before the test.** \n\nBecause the information is now compressed into the model's actual intelligence (its weights) rather than a temporary cache, the model can answer questions instantly (matching the constant speed of the fast index-card models) but with the high accuracy and scaling capability of the slow, page-turning Transformers. \n\n**This effectively decouples intelligence from memory costs, allowing for massive context lengths without the usual slowdown.**\n\n---\n\n\n######Link to the Paper: https:/", "source": "Reddit", "date": "2026-01-15T02:43:26", "author": "44th--Hokage", "score": 249}

I've been interviewing for research (some engineering) interships for the last 2 months, and I think I'm at a point of mental exhaustion from constant rejections and wasted time.\n\nFor context, I just started my master’s at Waterloo, but I'm a research associate at one of the top labs in Europe. I have been doing research since my sophomore year. I did not start in ML, but over the last year and a half, I ended up in ML research, first in protein design and now in pretraining optimization.\n\nI started applying for interships a few months ago, and after 10+ first-round interviews and endless OAs, I haven't landed any offers. Most of the companies that I've interviewed with were a mix of (non-FAANG) frontier AI companies, established deep tech startups, research labs of F100 companies, a couple non name startups, and a quant firm. I get past a few rounds, then get cut.\n\nThe feedback in general is that I'm not a good \"fit\" (a few companies told me I'm too researchy for a research engineer, another few were researching some niche stuff). And the next most common reason is that I failed the coding technical (I have no issue passing the research and ML theory technical interviews), but I think too slow for an engineer, and it's never the same type of questions (with one frontier company, I passed the research but failed the code review) and I'm not even counting OAs. Not a single one asked Leetcode or ML modelling; it's always some sort of a custom task that I have no prior experience with, so it's never the same stuff I can prepare.\n\nI'm at a loss, to be honest. Every PhD and a bunch of master's students in our lab have interned at frontier companies, and I feel like a failure that, after so many interviews, I can't get an offer. Because of my CV (no lies), I don't have a problem getting interviews, but I can't seem to get an offer. I've tried applying for non-research and less competitive companies, but I get hit with \"not a good fit.\"\n\nI have 3 technicals next week, and tbh I know for a fact I'm not gonna pass 2 of them (too stupid to be a quant researcher) and the other is a 3rd round technical, but from the way he described it I don't think I'll be passing it (they're gonna throw a scientific simulation coding problem at me). And I still need to schedule one more between those 3, but I'm not sure why they even picked me, I don't do RL or robotics research. After so many days and hours spent preparing for each technical only to get cut, I mentally can't get myself to prepare for them anymore. It's always a new random format.\n\nI'm severely burned out by this whole process, but time is running out. I love research, but I'm starting to hate the hiring process in this industry.

Retrospective ML won’t fix it. Curious if a workflow-native, outcome-driven approach could. [D]. Hi everyone I’m a fellowship-trained neurosurgeon / spine surgeon. I’ve been discussing a persistent problem in our field with other surgeons for a while, and I wanted to run it by people who think about ML systems, not just model performance.\n\nI’m trying to pressure-test whether a particular approach is even technically sound, where it would break, and what I’m likely underestimating. Id love to find an interested person to have a discussion with to get a 10000 feet level understanding of the scope of what I am trying to accomplish.\n\n**The clinical problem:**  \nFor the same spine pathology and very similar patient presentations, you can see multiple reputable surgeons and get very different surgical recommendations. anything from continued conservative management to decompression, short fusion, or long multilevel constructs. Costs and outcomes vary widely.\n\nThis isn’t because surgeons are careless. It’s because spine surgery operates with:\n\n* Limited prospective evidence\n* Inconsistent documentation\n* Weak outcome feedback loops\n* Retrospective datasets that are biased, incomplete, and poorly labeled\n\nEMRs are essentially digital paper charts. PACS is built for viewing images, not capturing *decision intent*. Surgical reasoning is visual, spatial, and 3D, yet we reduce it to free-text notes after the fact. From a data perspective, the learning signal is pretty broken.\n\n**Why I’m skeptical that training on existing data works:**\n\n* “Labels” are often inferred indirectly (billing codes, op notes)\n* Surgeon decision policies are non-stationary\n* Available datasets are institution-specific and access-restricted\n* Selection bias is extreme (who gets surgery vs who doesn’t is itself a learned policy)\n* Outcomes are delayed, noisy, and confounded\n\nEven with access, I’m not convinced retrospective supervision converges to something clinically useful.\n\n**The idea I’m exploring:**  \nInstead of trying to clean bad data later, what if the workflow itself generated structured, high-fidelity labels as a byproduct of doing the work, or at least the majority of it?\n\nConcretely, I’m imagining an EMR-adjacent, spine-specific surgical planning and case monitoring environment that surgeons would actually want to use. Not another PACS viewer, but a system that allows:\n\n* 3D reconstruction from pre-op imaging\n* Automated calculation of alignment parameters\n* Explicit marking of anatomic features tied to symptoms\n* Surgical plan modeling (levels, implants, trajectories, correction goals)\n* Structured logging of surgical cases (to derive patterns and analyze for trends)\n* Enable productivity (generate note, auto populate plans ect.)\n* Enable standardized automated patient outcomes data collection.\n\nThe key point isn’t the UI, but UI is also an area that currently suffers. It’s that surgeons would be forced (in a useful way) to externalize decision intent in a structured format because it directly helps them plan cases and generate documentation. Labeling wouldn’t feel like labeling it would almost just be how you work. The data used for learning would explicitly include post-operative outcomes. PROMs collected at standardized intervals, complications (SSI, reoperation), operative time, etc, with automated follow-up built into the system.\n\nThe goal would not be to replicate surgeon decisions, but to learn decision patterns that are associated with better outcomes. Surgeons could specify what they want to optimize for a given patient (eg pain relief vs complication risk vs durability), and the system would generate predictions conditioned on those objectives.\n\nOver time, this would generate:\n\n* Surgeon-specific decision + outcome datasets\n* Aggregate cross-surgeon data\n* Explicit representations of surgical choices, not just endpoints\n\nLearning systems could then train on:\n\n* Individual surgeon decision–outco", "source": "Reddit", "date": "2026-01-14T21:25:39", "author": "LaniakeaResident", "score": 31}

Any attempt to call out this toxicity is met with a wave of downvotes.\n\nFor those of you who have been in the Reddit echo chamber a little too long, let me remind you that it is not normal to mock/tease/tear down the work that someone did on their own free time for others to see or benefit from. It \\*is\\* normal to offer advice, open issues, offer reference work to learn from and ask questions to guide the author in the right direction.\n\nThis is an anonymous platform. The person sharing their work could be a 16 year old who has never seen a production system and is excited about programming, or a 30 yoe developer who got bored and just wanted to prove a concept, also in their free time. It does not make you a better to default to tearing someone down or mocking their work.\n\nYou poison the community as a whole when you do so. I am not seeing behavior like this as commonly on other language subs, otherwise I would not make this post. The people willing to build in public and share their sometimes unpolished work is what made tech and the Python ecosystem what it is today, in case any of you have forgotten.\n\n**—update—**\n\nThe majority of you are saying it’s because of LLM generated projects. This makes sense (to a limit); but, this toxicity is bleeding into some posts for projects that are clearly are not vibe-coded (existed before the LLM boom). I will not call anyone by name, but I occasionally see moderators taking part or enabling the behavior as well.\n\nAs someone commented, having an explanation for the behavior does not excuse the behavior. Hopefully this at least serves as a reminder of that for some of you.  The LLM spam is a problem that needs to be solved.

Hey r/Python,\n\nI love Streamlit's simplicity, but the \"full script rerun\" on every interaction drove me crazy. It gets super slow once your app grows, and using `st.cache` everywhere felt like a band-aid.\n\nSo I spent the last few weeks building **Violit**. I wanted something that feels like writing a simple Python script but performs like a modern React app.\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\nViolit is a high-performance Python web framework. It allows you to build interactive web apps using pure Python without the performance penalty of full-page reloads.\n\nIt uses a **\"Zero Rerun\"** architecture based on FastAPI, htmx, and WebSockets. When you interact with a widget (like a button or slider), Violit updates *only* that specific component in **O(1)** time, ensuring no screen flickering and instant feedback. It also supports running your web app into a desktop app (like electron) with a single flag (`--native`).\n\n**Target Audience**\n\n* **Data Scientists &amp; Python Devs:** Who need to build dashboards or internal tools quickly but are frustrated by Streamlit's lag.\n* **Production Use:** It's currently in early Alpha (v0.0.2), so it's best for internal tools, side projects, and early adopters who want to contribute to a faster Python UI ecosystem.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nHere is how Violit differs from existing alternatives:\n\n* **vs. Streamlit:** Violit keeps the intuitive API (90% compatible) but removes the \"Full Script Rerun.\" State updates are O(1) instead of O(N).\n* **vs. Dash:** Violit offers reactive state management without the \"callback hell\" complexity of Dash.\n* **vs. Reflex:** Violit requires **Zero Configuration**. No Node.js dependency, no build steps. Just `pip install` and run. Plus, it has built-in native desktop support.\n* **vs. NiceGUI:** The theme system for the beautiful app. Unlike Streamlit's rigid look or NiceGUI's engineer-first aesthetic, Violit comes with **30+  Themes** out of the box. You can switch from \"cyberpunk\" to \"retro\" styles with a single line of code—no CSS mastery required. **Plus, it's fully extensible—you can easily add your own custom themes via CSS.**\n\n**Code Example**\n\n    import violit as vl\n    ​\n    app = vl.App()\n    count = app.state(0)  # Reactive State\n    ​\n    # No rerun! Only the label updates instantly.\n    app.button(\"Increment\", on_click=lambda: count.set(count.value + 1))\n    app.write(\"Count:\", count)\n    ​\n    app.run()\n\n**Link to Source Code**\n\nIt is open source (MIT License).\n\n* **Repo:** [https://github.com/violit-dev/violit](https://github.com/violit-dev/violit)\n* **PyPI:** `pip install violit`\n* **Example:**\n   * [demo showcase source code](https://github.com/violit-dev/violit/blob/main/examples/1_demo_showcase/demo_showcase.py)\n   * [(Tutorial) Build Your Own Blog in 10 Minutes with Violit!](https://github.com/violit-dev/violit/tree/main/examples/2_violit_blog)\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback!", "source": "Reddit", "date": "2026-01-19T15:52:16", "author": "Puzzleheaded_Clerk68", "score": 133}

Hi everyone,\n\nI just created a new library called [opticol](https://github.com/lessico/opticol/) (which stands for optimized collections), which I wanted to share with the community. The idea of the library is to create space optimized versions of Sequence, Set, and Mapping for small collections leveraging the collections.ABC vocabulary.\n\n## What My Project Does\nCreates optimized versions of the main python collection types (Sequence, Set, Mapping) along with vocabulary types and convenience methods for transforming builtins to the optimized type.\n\nFor collections of size 3 or less, it is pretty trivial (using slots) to create an object that can act as a collection, but uses notably less memory than the builtins. Consider the fact that an empty set requires 216 bytes, or a dictionary with one element requires 224 bytes. Applications that create many (on the order of 100k to a million) of these objects can substantially reduce their memory usage with this library.\n\n## Target Audience\n\nThis will benefit users who use Python for various forms of data analysis. These problems often have many collection instances, which can often be just a few items. I myself have run into issues with memory pressure like this with some NLP datasets. Additionally, this is helpful for those doing this primarily in Python or for situations where dropping to a lower level language is not advantageous yet.\n\n## Comparison\n\nI could not find a similar library to this, nor even discussion of implementing such an idea. I would be happy to update this section if something comes up, but as far as I know, there are no direct comparisons.\n\nAnyway, it's currently a beta release as I'm working on finishing up the last unit tests, but the main use case generally works. I'm also very interested in any feedback on the project itself or other optimizations that may be good to add!", "source": "Reddit", "date": "2026-01-20T00:53:38", "author": "matgrioni", "score": 26}

I'm building an app with streamlit.\n&gt; Why streamlit?\n\nBecause I have no frontend experience and streamlit helped me get off the ground pretty quickly. Also, I'm simultaneously deploying to web and desktop,  and streamlit lets me do this with just the one codebase (I intend to use something like PyInstaller for distribution)\n\n\nI have different \"[expanders](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/layout/st.expander)\" in my streamlit application. Each expander has some data/input elements in it (in the case of my most recent problem, it's a `data_editor`). Sometimes, I need one element to update in response to the user clicking on \"Save Changes\" in a different part of the application. If they were both in the same fragment, I could just do `st.rerun(scope='fragment')`. But since they're not, I have no other choice but to do `st.rerun()`. But if there's incorrect input, I write an error message, which gets subsequently erased due to the rerun. Now I know that I can store this stuff in `st.session_state` and add additional logic to \"recreate\" the (prior) error-message state of the app, but that adds a lot of complexity.\n\nSince there is no way to `st.rerun()` a different fragment than the one I'm in, it looks like I have to give up streamlit - about time, I've been writing workarounds/hacks for a lot of streamlit stumbling blocks.\n\nSo, would anyone be able to recommend an alternative to streamlit? These are the criteria to determine viability of an alternative:\n\n1. ability to control the layout of my elements and programmatically refresh specific elements on demand\n1. web and desktop deployments from the same codebase\n  1. bonus points for being able to handle mobile deployments as well\n1. Python API - I can learn another language if the learning curve is fast. That takes Node/React out of the realm of possibility\n1. somewhat mature - I started using streamlit back in v0.35 or so. But now I'm using v1.52. While streamlit hasn't been around for as long as React, v1.52 is sufficiently mature. I doubt a flashy new frontend framework (eg: with current version 0.43) would have had enough time to iron out the bugs if it's only been around for a very short period of time (eg: 6 months).\n1. ideally something you have experience with and can therefore speak confidently to its stability/reliability\n\nI'm currently considering:\n\n1. [flet](https://flet.dev/): hasn't been around for very long - anyone know if it's any good?\n1. [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io)\n1. [Reflex](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex)\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, I'd love them\n\nThank you", "source": "Reddit", "date": "2026-01-16T00:10:21", "author": "inspectorG4dget", "score": 20}

Hi all,\n\nI've been working on a project called Dorsal for the last 18 months. It's a way to make unstructured data more queryable and organized, without having to upload files to a cloud bucket or pay for remote compute (my CPU/GPU can almost always handle my workloads).\n\n# What my Project Does\n\nDorsal is a Python library and CLI for generating, validating and managing structured file metadata. It scans files locally to generate validated JSON-serializable records. I personally use it for deduplicating files, adding annotations (structured metadata records) and organizing files by tags.\n\n* Core Extraction: Out of the box, it extracts \"universal\" metadata (Name, Hashes, Media Type; things any file has), as well and format-specific values (e.g., document page counts, video resolution, ebook titles/authors).\n* The Toolkit: It provides the scaffolding to build and plug in your own complex extraction models (like OCR, classification, or entity extraction, where the input is a file). It handles the pipeline execution, dependency management, and file I/O for you.\n* Strict Validation: It enforces Pydantic/JSON Schema on all outputs. If your custom extractor returns a float where a string is expected, Dorsal catches it before it pollutes your index.\n\nExample: a simple custom model for checking PDF files for sensitive words:\n\n    from dorsal import AnnotationModel\n    from dorsal.file.helpers import build_classification_record\n    from dorsal.file.preprocessing import extract_pdf_text\n    \n    SENSITIVE_LABELS = {\n        \"Confidential\": [\"confidential\", \"do not distribute\", \"private\"],\n        \"Internal\": [\"internal use only\", \"proprietary\"],\n    }\n    \n    class SensitiveDocumentScanner(AnnotationModel):\n        id: str = \"github:dorsalhub/annotation-model-examples\"\n        version: str = \"1.0.0\"\n    \n        def main(self) -&gt; dict | None:\n            try:\n                pages = extract_pdf_text(self.file_path)\n            except Exception as err:\n                self.set_error(f\"Failed to parse PDF: {err}\")\n                return None\n    \n            matches = set()\n            for text in pages:\n                text = text.lower()\n                for label, keywords in SENSITIVE_LABELS.items():\n                    if any(k in text for k in keywords):\n                        matches.add(label)\n    \n            return build_classification_record(\n                labels=list(matches),\n                vocabulary=list(SENSITIVE_LABELS.keys())\n            )\n\n\\^ This can be easily integrated into a locally-run linear pipeline, and executed via either the command line (by pointing at a file or directory) or in a python script.\n\n# Target Audience\n\n* ML Engineers / Data Scientists: Dorsal lets you make sure all of your output steps are validated, using a set of robust schemas for many common data engineering tasks (regression, entity extraction, classification etc.).\n* Data Hoarders / Archivists: People with massive local datasets (TB+) who like customizable tools for deduplication, tagging and even cloud querying\n* RAG Pipeline Builders: Turn folders of PDFs and docs into structured JSON chunks for vector embeddings\n\n# Links\n\n* Github: [https://github.com/dorsalhub/dorsal](https://github.com/dorsalhub/dorsal)\n* PyPI: pip install dorsalhub\n* Docs: [https://docs.dorsalhub.com](https://docs.dorsalhub.com)\n\n# Comparison\n\n|Feature|Dorsal|Cloud ETL (AWS/GCP)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Integrity**|Hash-based|Upload required|\n|**Validation**|JSON Schema / Pydantic|API Dependent|\n|**Cost**|Free (Local Compute)|$$$ (Per Page)|\n|**Workflow**|Standardized Pipeline|Vendor Lock-in|\n\nAny and all feedback is extremely welcome!", "source": "Reddit", "date": "2026-01-20T16:25:00", "author": "AverageMechUser", "score": 19}

Hello!\n\nLast year, I started writing a Python C4 model authoring tool, and it has come to a point where I feel good enough to share it with you guys so you can start playing around with it locally and render the C4 model views with PlantUML.\n\nGitHub repo: [https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr](https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr)\n\nDocumentation here: [https://buildzr.dev](https://buildzr.dev/)\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nbuildzr is a [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) authoring tool for Python programmers. It allows you to declaratively or procedurally author Structurizr models and diagrams.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Structurizr, it is both an open standard (see [Structurizr JSON schema](https://github.com/structurizr/json)) and a [set of tools](https://docs.structurizr.com/usage) for building software architecture diagrams as code. Structurizr derives its architecture modeling paradigm based on the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/), the modeling language for describing software architectures and their relationships.\n\nIn Structurizr, you define architecture models (System Context, Container, Component, and Code) and their relationships first. And then, you can re-use the models to present multiple perspectives, views, and stories about your architecture.\n\nbuildzr supercharges this workflow with Pythonic syntax sugar and intuitive APIs that make modeling as code more fun and productive.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nUse buildzr if you want to have an intuitive and powerful tool for writing C4 architecture models:\n\n* **Intuitive Pythonic Syntax**: Use Python's context managers (`with` statements) to create nested structures that naturally mirror your architecture's hierarchy. See the [example](https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr#quick-example).\n* **Programmatic Creation**: Use buildzr's DSL APIs to programmatically create C4 model architecture diagrams. Great for automation!\n* **Advanced Styling**: Style elements beyond just tags --- target by direct reference, type, group membership, or custom predicates for fine-grained visual control. Just take a look at [Styles](https://buildzr.dev/user-guide/styles/)!\n* **Cloud Provider Themes**: Add AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and Oracle Cloud icons to your diagrams with IDE-discoverable constants. No more memorizing tag strings! See [Themes](https://buildzr.dev/user-guide/themes/).\n* **Standards Compliant**: Stays true to the [Structurizr JSON schema](https://github.com/structurizr/json) standards. buildzr uses [datamodel-code-generator](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator) to automatically generate the low-level representation of the Workspace model.\n* **Rich Toolchain**: Uses the familiar Python programming language and its rich toolchains to write software architecture models and diagrams!\n\nQuick example, so you can get the idea (more examples and explanations at [https://buildzr.dev](https://buildzr.dev)):\n\n    from buildzr.dsl import (\n        Workspace,\n        SoftwareSystem,\n        Person,\n        Container,\n        SystemContextView,\n        ContainerView,\n        desc,\n        Group,\n        StyleElements,\n    )\n    from buildzr.themes import AWS\n    \n    with Workspace('w') as w:\n    \n        # Define your models (architecture elements and their relationships).\n    \n        with Group(\"My Company\") as my_company:\n            u = Person('Web Application User')\n            webapp = SoftwareSystem('Corporate Web App')\n            with webapp:\n                database = Container('database')\n                api = Container('api')\n                api &gt;&gt; (\"Reads and writes data from/to\", \"http/api\") &gt;&gt; database\n        with Group(\"Microsoft\") as microsoft:\n            email_system = SoftwareSystem('Microsoft 365')\n    \n        u &gt;&gt; [\n            desc(\"Reads and writes email using\") &gt;&gt; email_system,\n            desc(\"Create work order using\") &gt;&gt; webapp,\n        ]", "source": "Reddit", "date": "2026-01-20T11:39:20", "author": "scribe-kiddie", "score": 17}

I now have the project in a stable state where I need more feedback on real-life usage and testing.\n\nHere are some examples of it in action:\n\n## Simple API\n\n```python\nfrom clientele import api\n\nclient = api.APIClient(base_url=\"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2\")\n\n@client.get(\"/pokemon/{pokemon_name}\")\ndef get_pokemon_info(pokemon_name: str, result: dict) -&gt; dict:\n    return result\n```\n\n## Simple POST request\n\n```python\nfrom clientele import api\n\nclient = api.APIClient(base_url=\"https://httpbin.org\")\n\n\n@client.post(\"/post\")\ndef post_input_data(data: dict, result: dict) -&gt; dict:\n    return result\n```\n\n## Streaming responses\n\n```python\nfrom typing import AsyncIterator\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom clientele import api\n\nclient = api.APIClient(base_url=\"http://localhost:8000\")\n\nclass Event(BaseModel):\n    text: str\n\n@client.get(\"/events\", streaming_response=True)\nasync def stream_events(*, result: AsyncIterator[Event]) -&gt; AsyncIterator[Event]:\n    return result\n```\n\nNew features include:\n\n- Handle streaming responses for Server Sent Events\n- Handle custom response parsing with callbacks\n- Sensible HTTP caching decorator with extendable backends\n- A Mypy plugin to handle the way the library injects parameters\n- Many many tweaks and updates to handle edge-case OpenAPI schemas\n\nPlease star ⭐ the project, give it a download and let me know what you think: https://github.com/phalt/clientele", "source": "Reddit", "date": "2026-01-15T17:25:53", "author": "phalt_", "score": 15}

This makes sequence trajectories geometrically interpretable and supports vector arithmetic on histories (e.g., A − B + C style analogies on event trajectories).\n\nFrom the Python side, you primarily interact with a scikit‑learn‑style estimator:\n\n    python\n    from event2vector import Event2Vec\n    \n    model = Event2Vec(\n        num_event_types=len(vocab),\n        geometry=\"euclidean\",   # or \"hyperbolic\"\n        embedding_dim=128,\n        pad_sequences=True,\n        num_epochs=50,\n    )\n    model.fit(train_sequences, verbose=True)\n    embeddings = model.transform(train_sequences)\n\nThere are both Euclidean and hyperbolic (Poincaré ball) variants, so you can choose flat vs hierarchical geometry for your event space.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nPython users working with discrete event sequences: logs, clickstreams, POS tags, user journeys, synthetic processes, etc.\n\nE.g. posts about shopping patterns [https://substack.com/home/post/p-181632020?source=queue](https://substack.com/home/post/p-181632020?source=queue) or geometry of languages [https://sulcantonin.substack.com/p/the-geometry-of-language-families](https://sulcantonin.substack.com/p/the-geometry-of-language-families)\n\nPeople who want interpretable, geometric representations of sequences rather than just “it works but I can’t see what it’s doing.”\n\nIt is currently more of a research/analysis tool and prototyping library than a fully battle‑hardened production system, but:\n\nIt is MIT‑licensed and on PyPI (`pip install event2vector`).\n\nIt has a scikit‑style API (`fit`, `fit_transform`, `transform`, `most_similar`) and optional padded batching + GPU support, so it should drop into many Python ML workflows.\n\n# Comparison\n\n**Versus Word2Vec and similar context‑window models:**\n\nWord2Vec is excellent for capturing local co‑occurrence and semantic similarity, but it does not model the ordered trajectory of a sequence; contexts are effectively treated as bags of neighbors.\n\nEvent2Vector, in contrast, explicitly treats the hidden state as an ordered sum of event embeddings, and its training objective enforces that likely future events lie along the trajectory of that sum. This lets it capture sequential structure and trajectory geometry that Word2Vec is not designed to represent.\n\nIn the paper, an unsupervised experiment on the Brown Corpus shows that Event2Vector’s additive sequence embeddings produce clearer clusters of POS‑tag patterns than a Word2Vec baseline when you compose tag sequences and visualize them.\n\n**Versus generic RNNs / LSTMs / transformers:**\n\nThose models are more expressive and often better for pure prediction, but their hidden states are usually hard to interpret geometrically.\n\nEvent2Vector intentionally trades some expressivity for a simple, reversible additive structure: sequences are trajectories in a space where addition/subtraction have a clear meaning, and you can inspect them with PCA/t‑SNE or do analogical reasoning.\n\n# Python‑centric details\n\n* Install: `pip install event2vector` \n* Github Repo: [https://github.com/sulcantonin/event2vec\\_public/tree/main](https://github.com/sulcantonin/event2vec_public/tree/main)\n\nAccepts integer‑encoded sequences (Python lists / tensors), with optional padding for minibatching.\n\nProvides a tiny synthetic quickstart (START→A/B→C→END) that trains in seconds on CPU and plots embeddings with matplotlib, plus a Brown Corpus POS example that mirrors the paper.\n\nI’d love feedback f", "source": "Reddit", "date": "2026-01-18T15:41:43", "author": "sulcantonin", "score": 12}

{"title": "Natural language processing", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "content": "Natural language processing (NLP) is the processing of natural language information by a computer. NLP is a subfield of computer science and is closely associated with artificial intelligence. NLP is also related to information retrieval, knowledge representation, computational linguistics, and linguistics more broadly.\nMajor processing tasks in an NLP system include: speech recognition, text classification, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.\n\nHistory\nNatural language processing has its roots in the 1950s. Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.\n\nSymbolic NLP (1950s – early 1990s)\nThe premise of symbolic NLP is often illustrated using John Searle's Chinese room thought experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.\n\n1950s: The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem.  However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America (though some research continued elsewhere, such as Japan and Europe) until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed.\n1960s: Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted \"blocks worlds\" with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapy, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966. Despite using minimal information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA was able to produce interactions that appeared human-like. When the \"patient\" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to \"My head hurts\" with \"Why do you say your head hurts?\". Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because that was all that would fit in a computer  memory at the time.\n1970s: During the 1970s, many programmers began to write \"conceptual ontologies\", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data.  Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).  During this time, the first chatterbots were written (e.g., PARRY).\n1980s: The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP. Focus areas of the time included research on rule-based parsing (e.g., the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar), morphology (e.g., two-level morphology), semantics (e.g., Lesk algorithm), reference (e.g., within Centering Theory) and other areas of natural language understanding (e.g., in the Rhetorical Structure Theory). Other lines of research were continued, e.g., the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky. An important development (that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s) was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period.\n\nStatistical NLP (1990s–present)\nUp until the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. This shift was influenced by increasing computational power (see Moore's law) and a decline in the dominance of Chomskyan linguistic theories... (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing. \n\n1990s: Many of the notable early successes in statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research, such as IBM alignment models. These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems o", "source": "Wikipedia", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}
{"title": "Deep learning", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "content": "In machine learning, deep learning focuses on utilizing multilayered neural networks to perform tasks such as classification, regression, and representation learning. The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and revolves around stacking artificial neurons into layers and \"training\" them to process data. The adjective \"deep\" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network. Methods used can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\nSome common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, transformers, and neural radiance fields. These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.\nEarly forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems, particularly the human brain. However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose.\n\nOverview\nMost modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.\nFundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a progressively more abstract and composite representation. For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels). The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face.\nImportantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own. Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on. In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.\nThe word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two. CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively.\nDeep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.\nDeep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data is more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks.\nThe term deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons.

Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\nML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.\nStatistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning.\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework.\n\nHistory\nThe term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. The synonym self-teaching computers was also used during this time period.\nThe earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.\nBy the early 1960s, an experimental \"learning machine\" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nils Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981, a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.\nTom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P,  improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question, \"Can machines think?\", is replaced with the question, \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".\nModern-day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithm types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.\n\nCurrent Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression.\nCurrent Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule.\nCurrent Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unknown time and are broken down to either be studies of model-based methods or model-free methods.\nIn 2014 Ian Goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) with realistic data synthesis. By 2016 AlphaGo obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques.\n\nRelationships to other fields\nArtificial intelligence\nAs a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artifi", "source": "Wikipedia", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}
{"title": "Artificial intelligence", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) – AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks, and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms. Ethical concerns have been raised about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n\nGoals\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\n\nReasoning and problem-solving\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\n\nKnowledge representation\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the", "source": "Wikipedia", "date": null, "author": null, "score": null}
